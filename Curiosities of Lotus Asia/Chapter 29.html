"I haven't seen Sumireko lately... Has she been visiting the shrine?"
</p><p>
"No...? Come to think of it, I haven't seen her around. So she's not coming here to Kourindou anymore either, huh."
</p><p>
"I see. Well, if the reason she's been coming to Gensokyo in her dreams has stopped, or if she's simply gotten bored, I suppose that's fine. But I'm a little worried."
</p><p>
After the summer heat abated, Gensokyo had fully entered into autumn. Reimu was paying a visit to the poorly ventilated curio shop, Kourindou.
</p><p>
It would be awful if Sumireko had gotten stranded somewhere in Gensokyo, or been attacked by youkai.
</p><p>
"You've got a point. We have no way of visiting her home in the outside world, and we can't go talk to anyone who knows her in her daily life either. So unless she shows up, we have no way to confirm her safety. What a pain."
</p><p>
"So what do we do? Leave it be?"
</p><p>
"Even if she's from the outside world, once she enters Gensokyo she's just another human. And it's my job to keep the humans of Gensokyo safe. So leave it to me!"
</p><p>
Reimu responded with a baseless confidence.
</p><p>
The cool autumn wind blows through the Hakurei Shrine. It's a gathering place for both Incident resolution specialists and those who cause Incidents.
</p><p>
"It's no good. I tried everything I could think of, but still haven't got a good lead. How about you, Reimu?"
</p><p>
Marisa threw up her hands in defeat.
</p><p>
"Nothing on my end either. But I guess we could take the fact that we have no leads as proof that she's not coming to Gensokyo, and just living her life safe in the outside world."
</p><p>
"Sure, but it's not like we can search every last corner of Gensokyo. She coulda been washed away by the river, taken by youkai, or even sent to who-knows-what Otherworld without leaving a trace."
</p><p>
"If she was really gone 'without a trace' then she'd be completely wiped from our minds. It'd be as if she never existed, and there wouldn't be any problem."
</p><p>
"You're thinking like it's a dream that's getting worse, huh? Oh, speaking of dreams..."
</p><p>
"What?"
</p><p>
"This isn't related, but I've heard Sumireko's been showing up in people's dreams. And from multiple people, too."
</p><p>
"Really? Huh. She sticks in people's minds more than you'd expect, huh?"
</p><p>
"They tell me that in these dreams, they're going on a rampage when they get cleanly beaten. And for whatever reason a lot of people are having these dreams. Even people who don't normally see her. Pretty strange coincidence..."
</p><p>
At that moment, both Reimu and Marisa simultaneously had the same thought.
</p><p>
"No way... right?"~
</p><p>
"Well, I still think it's a coincidence... I mean, a coincidence where even people who don't know her are seeing her in their dreams..."
</p><p>
On hearing that put into words, they both became certain.
</p><p>
"Don't tell me Sumireko's lost in the dream world?!"
</p><p>
Kourindou had been set up as the "Sumireko Usami's Disappearance Task Force Headquarters." All the information they'd gathered was written on a chalk board. The members are Reimu, Marisa, and Rinnosuke.
</p><p>
"I see. So you're saying that Sumireko is lost in this dream world that everyone is seeing? But isn't the dream world just an imaginary place inside your head?"?
</p><p>
"I think so, but I've been there plenty of times myself too. It definitely exists in reality. Maybe it's a contradiction to say it's in "reality" when the dream world and reality are two sides of the same coin though."
</p><p>
Reimu is in disarray over all the things she doesn't quite understand. Marisa is faring no better.
</p><p>
"If it's the dream world, we can't just do a straightforward manhunt. First we need to confirm if Sumireko's actually even there. Which is what we're here to talk about."
</p><p>
Marisa turned to Rinnosuke as she said this.
</p><p>
"Do you have anything that can show someone any dream they want?"
</p><p>
"Any dream you want? Of course I do."
</p><p>
"Seriously?"
</p><p>
"There's something like that among the items that drift in from the outside world."
</p><p>
Rinnosuke disappeared into a mountain of junk.
</p><p>
"Whoa, I was just asking just in case! I can't believe the outside world really has something that controls dreams."
</p><p>
"Well, I'd temper my expectations if I were you..."
</p><p>
Rinnosuke returned carrying something like an eye mask.
</p><p>
"So what is it?"
</p><p>
"I don't how it's supposed to work, but apparently if you wear this eye mask as you go to sleep, you'll have lucid dreams. As a lucid dream is one where everything goes according to your wishes, I think you can use this to see whatever dream you want."
</p><p>
Marisa fiddles with the mysterious eye mask.
</p><p>
"I don't get it, but that sounds awesome! I'm borrowing this!"
</p><p>
"Go right ahead. Frankly, its effectiveness is... well, you'll see."
</p><p>
Perhaps because she had no interest in this item, Reimu was doodling on a piece of paper.
</p><p>
"What are you drawing?"
</p><p>
"You know how people used to put pictures under their pillows of the dreams they wanted to see? I'm drawing a picture of Sumireko."
</p><p>
"Wh-What part of that is Sumireko?"
</p><p>
I couldn't find a single word of praise for that drawing. Whoever put that under their pillow would no doubt see only nightmares. That said, she was dead serious so I said nothing.Â´
</p><p>
Afterward, the two of them went home, hoping to meet Sumireko in their dreams.
</p><p>
They convened at the task force headquarters again the next day. Marisa was excited, but Reimu was a little exhausted.
</p><p>
"So how'd it go?"
</p><p>
"Man, this mask was great! It's pitch black with it on, so I could sleep without any distractions! Thanks to this I woke up completely refreshed!"
</p><p>
"Oh? That's nice. But what about the dreams?"
</p><p>
"Nah, I slept too soundly to see any dreams. But I sure am lucid after getting so much rest!"
</p><p>
I see. So that's "lucid dreaming" in another sense then?
</p><p>
"Then what about you, Reimu? You seem tired though."
</p><p>
"I put this picture under my pillow, but was too busy thinking 'come on out!' to actually fall asleep..."
</p><p>
"Oh, that sounds awful. Maybe you should wear the lucid dreaming eye mask next time."
</p><p>
Both of their plans had failed. But what could they even do if they did meet Sumireko in a dream? And is it really possible for someone to be lost in the dream world in the first place?
</p><p>
Why are these two so sure that her disappearance has something to do with the dream world anyway?
</p><p>
"The dream world definitely exists. I've been there plenty of times."
</p><p>
"You mean, physically?"
</p><p>
"Yeah, physically. Sometimes it's like outer space, other times it's not too different from reality."
</p><p>
"Okay, but do you have any basis for believing that was actually the dream world?"
</p><p>
"Um... Well there was someone there who said 'this is the dream world!'"
</p><p>
"Was that the 'ruler of dreams' you told me about before?
</p><p>
"Yeah, her. But she's not the only one. Other dream world residents have told me it was the dream world too."
</p><p>
"In that case, wouldn't it be faster to find this 'ruler of dreams' and see if she knows anything? You know, for solving Sumireko's disappearance."
</p><p>
"Oh, right!"
</p><p>
Reimu clapped it hands together. However Marisa said "It's even harder to find <em>her</em> though."
</p><p>
The meeting concluded with the sleep-deprived Reimu taking the lucid dreaming mask and Marisa taking home a ruler-of-dreams-esque picture. Rinnosuke thought the search for Sumireko was hopeless.
</p><p>
Ding a ling.
</p><p>
The autumn dusk was coming in quickly as a visitor arrived at Kourindou.
</p><p>
"Oh, if it isn't the mountain hermit? What brings you here today?"
</p><p>
"I have a few questions for you."
</p><p>
The visitor was Kasen Ibara.
</p><p>
"What is it?"
</p><p>
"Has Sumireko Usami not been coming here?"
</p><p>
"Oh, so it's about that. No, I haven't seen her here lately."
</p><p>
"As I thought. It seems she hasn't been able to see any dreams lately."
</p><p>
"Oh, really? Wait, does that mean you've met her recently?"
</p><p>
"Hm? Well, yes, I suppose. She's doing fine."
</p><p>
"Um... Oh, I see. So you're saying you met her in the outside world then?"
</p><p>
"I'll leave that your imagination."
</p><p>
In other words, this hermit had made the forbidden trek to the outside world and confirmed Sumireko's presence. I see, if you can do that then that's clearly the easiest way to handle this. At least we know she's in one piece now.
</p><p>
"Is that so? Thank goodness Sumireko is alright. We've been running a search effort from our end, but even after trying this-and-that, we couldn't find a trace of her. We were even starting to think she might be trapped in the dream world, of all things."
</p><p>
"Trapped in the dream world? What do you mean?"
</p><p>
"Well, it's just Reimu's overactive imagination. Like, she thought Sumireko wasn't appearing in Gensokyo because she's lost in the dream world or something."
</p><p>
"Reimu wouldn't say something like that without a reason. Not to mention that while Sumireko may be in perfect health, I'm told she doesn't see dreams even while asleep, so she's been unable to come to Gensokyo. It seems likely that this is related to Reimu's intuition."
</p><p>
"Dreams? That does sound related, but didn't you say she's not seeing dreams? That's the exact opposite of Reimu's guess that she was trapped in the dream world."
</p><p>
"If this involves dreams, then it's out of our hands here in reality. We'll need to call her in."
</p><p>
"Her?"
</p><p>
"The ruler of dreams, Doremy Sweet."
</p><p>
The next day, at Kourindou.
</p><p>
Kasen Ibara had joined the "Sumireko Usami's Disappearance Task Force" who were gradually uncovering the truth.
</p><p>
"Reimu should be here with Doremy soon."
</p><p>
"And you even said you didn't know where she was. Nice job catching her."
</p><p>
"Apparently she threw a tantrum in a dream, shouting "get out here!" etc, until she got Doremy to promise to come here. All she needed was to use that mask that brings lucid dreams."
</p><p>
"I-I see. So she saw a lucid dream. With that mask."
</p><p>
Ding a ling.
</p><p>
"Sorry for the wait. I brought the ruler of dreams."
</p><p>
"Oh, hello there everyone. I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams."
</p><p>
Reimu entered the shop with the ruler of dreams. Just by saying the words 'ruler of dreams,' a strange atmosphere covered the store, as if we were no longer in reality.
</p><p>
"This is about Sumireko, right? Yes, it's true that she's lost in Gensokyo's dream world, and it's also true that the real her can no longer see dreams."
</p><p>
"Hm? What do you mean?"
</p><p>
"There are some... extremely complicated circumstances surrounding her dreams. For example, why is she only able to come to Gensokyo while dreaming?"
</p><p>
This is how the ruler of dreams explained it. To Sumireko, Gensokyo was originally the dream world she longed for. At first, coming to Gensokyo was just like coming to the dream world for her. But when she physically crossed the barrier to Gensokyo, she was affected by the 'Urban Legend Incident' and her physical body was split in two, with part of her remaining in Gensokyo. The one left in Gensokyo was her doppelganger.
</p><p>
"So you're saying Sumireko is two people?"
</p><p>
"I believe that whenever she was asleep in the outside world, she shares her consciousness with her doppelganger. As a doppelganger is a being that cannot exist without its original, it would only appear while she was dreaming.
</p><p>
"Hmm.. I don't get it."
</p><p>
Question marks were appearing over everyone's heads.
</p><p>
"That's how it's been until now, at any rate. And while you asked if there were two Sumirekos, there were actually three. The 'Sumireko in the outside world', 'Sumireko's doppelganger in Gensokyo', and the 'dream Sumireko' who you would originally see. As for what's happening now, long story short the dream Sumireko went wild, stole the physical body of the doppelganger, and is now rampaging through the dream world. As a result, the real Sumireko is no longer seeing dreams, and therefore the doppelganger is no longer appearing."
</p><p>
"Meaning... what? Um... So what's the problem, and how do we fix it? Wait, is there even a problem at all?"
</p><p>
Reimu was clearly confused.
</p><p>
"The dream Sumireko is under the impression that she's the original Sumireko and is trying to escape the dream world. If she happens to succeed, she'll switch places with the real one, forget that she was the dream version, and most likely begin to lead an ordinary life. So there's no particular problem."
</p><p>
"U-Um, are you sure that's not a problem?"
</p><p>
Marisa is bewildered as well.
</p><p>
"It's just, the dream residents can be awfully sensitive. They're thinking 'if you can have a real body, then why can't we?!' and are trying to stop her out of jealousy. So the dream world is currently full of these aggressive nightmares. When you wake up from one you're just drenched in sweat. If there's a problem with this situation, then that's it."
</p><p>
Everyone was silent. They felt something was lacking from the ruler of dream's confusing explanation. They couldn't even be sure if Sumireko was missing or not. Completely unsure of the solution, they nonetheless felt the need for closure.
</p><p>
"A-Anyway! So Sumireko isn't missing. She hasn't been attacked by a youkai. Heck, nothing's even really happened. Can we think of it like that?
</p><p>
Reimu voiced her thoughts.
</p><p>
"I don't see a problem with that."
</p><p>
"O-Okay. So this is none of our business then."
</p><p>
Reimu resigned herself.
</p><p>
"H-Hey! Not fair! Don't you remember who roped me into this by shouting "we need to rescue the humans of Gensoyko!"?!
</p><p>
"C'mon, we're saving them, aren't we? I mean, if there's no incident then what are we even saving them from?"
</p><p>
"Hold on."
</p><p>
Kasen Ibara interjected.
</p><p>
"Based on what we heard just now, there's still a human who hasn't been saved."
</p><p>
"Who?"
</p><p>
"Sumireko's doppelganger. We're calling her a doppelganger, but she's no different from the real Sumireko, is she? Hey, Doremy. What happens to the doppelganger if the dream Sumireko takes over for the real one like you were saying?"
</p><p>
"Hmm, let's see... I think that because the dream Sumireko has stolen the doppelganger's body and is trying to get to the outside world, that will give birth to two Sumirekos in the real world. When they meet, one of them will probably be annihilated. Furthermore, I believe Sumireko would never appear in Gensokyo again, because her doppelganger would be gone."
</p><p>
Doremy said this with a smile.
</p><p>
After that, the "Sumireko Usami's Disappearance Task Force Headquarters" changed its name to "Saving Sumireko Usami's Doppelganger Task Force Headquarters" and continued their strategizing.
</p><p>
That said, since only one of them could freely interact with the dream world, their strategies mostly involved just leaving it to her.
</p><p>
"While the simplest plan would be to defeat her in the dream world and wait for a new dream Sumireko to manifest, for some mysterious reason reason she's become absurdly powerful, and ordinary methods will no longer work. Perhaps her belief that she's the real one has give her intense feelings about not wanting to be defeated, or perhaps someone else has been working from behind the scenes."
</p><p>
"Aren't you the ruler of dreams? Can't you just forcibly remake the dream or something?"
</p><p>
Reimu seemed frustrated.
</p><p>
"I can't interfere to that extent. I may call myself a ruler, but I'm closer to the zookeeper of a zoo full of dream residents. A zookeeper can't simply make a new animal. I could spur the other dream residents to fight her though."
</p><p>
"Okay, then I guess our only choice is to get someone strong to defeat her for us. Oh, I know! If we want to win, just cheat and have a bunch of 'em attack her at once!"
</p><p>
"Well, I suppose I could ask, but whether or not that actually happens will be up to the dream dweller's whims. Everyone's so free-spirited after all."
</p><p>
"I hate having to rely on others... Isn't there some kind of better way?"
</p><p>
Rinnosuke, who had been lost in thought this whole time, suddenly spoke up.
</p><p>
"By the way, what's happening right now to Gensokyo's Sumireko, the one we've been calling a doppelganger?"
</p><p>
"Well, the dream Sumireko took her body, so she's a disembodied spirit, unable to move. Why?"
</p><p>
"Is there any way she could move in the dream world?"
</p><p>
"It's not impossible. Wait, don't tell me you mean...?"
</p><p>
"In that case, isn't Sumireko the only one who can solve her own problem? Let her decide which one's the real one, or which one deserves a real body."
</p><p>
"You're saying let the doppelganger and the dream Sumireko fight it out? But what if the doppelganger loses?"
</p><p>
Reimu seemed panicked.
</p><p>
"Then I doubt Sumireko will appear in Gensokyo ever again. I don't see a problem, so shall we try it?"
</p><p>
Doremy smiled.
</p><p>
"Fine, why not? This isn't the outside world Sumireko's problem. She never went missing in the first place. Whatever happens, happens."
</p><p>
It had been about three weeks since I'd visited Gensokyo.
</p><p>
For whatever reason, I stopped being able to see dreams, so I couldn't come to Gensokyo. But nothing had changed in Gensokyo over the last three weeks. Kourindou was the same as ever.
</p><p>
"Man, it's really been a while, hasn't it? It's so refreshingly cool here in Gensokyo!"
</p><p>
"Oh, so you're alright? I was worried."
</p><p>
"I just stopped seeing dreams. I thought it might be a sleep disorder, so I went to see a doctor about it, but then I suddenly started seeing them again. I still don't know why though, so it's a little scary."
</p><p>
"Right. For all you know you fought and won against something in your dreams."
</p><p>
"? Speaking of fighting though, I was going through the photos on my smartphone, and look, isn't this Reimu? And there are a bunch of others too, all sorts of youkai fighting... Someone else must've used my smartphone, right?"
</p><p>
My smartphone album was filled danmaku and youkai I'd never seen before. All sorts of things were recorded.
</p><p>
"Wow, what an awful picture of danmaku."
</p><p>
"It's an amazing picture! Next time I'll have to bring an old camera and take a bunch of pictures of everyone. Maybe I'll become Instagram famous!"
</p><p>
In addition to the pictures, my smartphone also had recorded a diary that I didn't write. After reading it, I couldn't explain why, but I had the feeling that during the time I wasn't dreaming, I'd been seeing nothing but nightmares.
