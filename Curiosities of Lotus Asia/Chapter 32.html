---The cherry blossoms had fallen, and the Hakurei Shrine was wrapped in fresh greenery.
<br><br>
The new leaves of spring contain a magic power that gives humans vitality. It's the season that's best suited for beginning something new. Sumireko Usami, a student from the Outside World, was paying a visit to Reimu Hakurei, the shrine's resident shrine maiden.
<br><br>
"*Sigh*... Part-time stuff, huh. Maybe I ought to start doing something, too?"
<br><br>
"Something to do part-time? You mean a job?"
<br><br>
"Yeah. I've seen some other students starting part-time jobs lately. I mean, it's technically against the rules, but..."
<br><br>
"You did mention that you were in school, right? So do even students get jobs? Don't your parents pay for things for you?"
<br><br>
"Hmm, good question. It's true that they're not all just getting jobs for the sake of money. It's, like... practice for getting into society, I'd say? They think that having a job makes them look more mature. They get bored of a childhood where all they're ever expected to do is study, and they're desperate to grow up faster than everyone else. That might be it. Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel kinda pressured too, seeing everyone else getting jobs. But when it comes to work that you can do as a high-schooler, it's gotta be a part-time thing. 'Course, once you're an adult, you might start hating work altogether. So I guess I'd want to do it while I still have that chance..."
<br><br>
Sumireko rambled on as if trying to explain herself, then turned her face towards Reimu's.
<br><br>
"Hey, speaking of. You've already got a job, right, Reimucchi? As a shrine maiden."
<br><br>
"Huh? Er, well... I suppose so."
<br><br>
"Man, the humans in Gensokyo are so cool. You've all got jobs from such a young age."
<br><br>
"Y-you think so?"
<br><br>
"Like, you've got your shrine maiden job, your youkai-exterimation job, and you do a bunch of other stuff like resolving incidents too. And you're properly contributing to society with all of it."
<br><br>
"Well, it's not like it's that impressive..."
<br><br>
Reimu was embarrassed by the sudden compliments.
<br><br>
"The only part-time jobs you can get as a high-schooler are stuff like cash register duty. Nothing fancy like defeating youkai and protecting humanity..."
<br><br>
Sumireko pictured herself working at a convenience store, bored out of her mind, and sighed.
<br><br>
"Speaking of whiiich. How are those jobs working out for you on this front, anyway?"
<br><br>
Sumireko formed a circle with her thumb and index finger, and leered over at Reimu. As Reimu saw this, she made the same circle gesture in response.
<br><br>
"...Yeah. It's a pretty flashy job, so youkai and the like give me enough of it to make me sick of the whole thing."
<br><br>
At this, Sumireko's face lit up.
<br><br>
"Enough to make you sick of it?!"
<br><br>
"Oh, absolutely. It's such a pain. It takes everything I've got just to dodge the stuff. The danmaku, I mean."
<br><br>
"Danmaku!" Sumireko nearly fell off her seat.
<br><br>
"No, not that! I'm miming a coin, see? I'm trying to ask how much you're earning."
<br><br>
Reimu's face turned slightly red at her misunderstanding.
<br><br>
"Oh, money? Um, well, err..."
<br><br>
"Well, I guess you don't really look like you're earning all that much, anyway."
<br><br>
"Money... why would you ask about that?"
<br><br>
"Why? 'Cause I'm curious, duh! When you're looking for a job, practically the number-one most important thing to consider is money. Wages."~
<br><br>
"Ah, I see. I do want money, that's true. But my job isn't something I chose so that I could get money out of it. The shrine maiden thing is something I was born to do, and it's not like anyone pays me a cent for resolving incidents, either."
<br><br>
"Wait, so it's all volunteer work?"
<br><br>
"Maybe? But when I think about it, people do give me money in some form or another, in the end. And the shrine does get a boost in donations, to an extent... But, I've always thought a 'job' is something that you do because, well, it's what you do."
<br><br>
"Hmmm. Well, doesn't that sound cool. Very upstanding. Jobs are things you do for the sake of it, and not for money, huh...?"
<br><br>
"Didn't you say that just a minute ago? Students don't work for the sake of money, and all that."
<br><br>
"Huh? No, no, that was separate thing! ...Well, no. Maybe it wasn't? I kind of lost where I was going with this."
<br><br>
"Kourindou," a curio shop located near the miasma-filled Forest of Magic.
<br><br>
The main products it deals in are objects that drift in from the Outside World. The shopkeeper, Rinnosuke Morichika, was up to his neck in new goods that needed sorting.
<br><br>
"...This many computers, and they're all dead inventory. I can hardly sell any of these... It's a shame, but I suppose I'll have to thin things out."
<br><br>
He looked at the huge pile of computers. There were vertical cases, horizontal cases, laptops, even the odd tablet-- all of varying generations and specifications, and all in complete disarray.
<br><br>
"That's a tall order in its own right, though. Honestly, how am I supposed to sort these? Sumireko did say 'the smaller ones are newer and higher-performance, so they're worth more,' but when it comes to your typical antique shop, products ought to be worth more the older and larger they are. In the end, I haven't got the slightest idea about which of these I ought to keep and which I ought to throw out."
<br><br>
Rinnosuke decided to call in a specialist some time soon, and quickly gave up on doing any organizing himself.
<br><br>
"...And thus, I've brought you here today for one very important reason. I'd like you to appraise the personal computers I have in stock."
<br><br>
Sumireko was genuinely surprised.
<br><br>
"Oh my gosh, you've got so many! It's like an entire shop in here!"
<br><br>
"I mean, it is a shop."
<br><br>
"Oh, right. Technically. Sorry, I meant that it's like a whole second-hand computer shop."
<br><br>
Sumireko triumphantly set about the task that'd been requested of her.
<br><br>
"...I've never even seen most of these models. I'm sure you could get a good price for some of these if you took them to the right place, but... I'd say that most of these are probably just scrap?"
<br><br>
"By 'scrap', do you mean they're garbage?"
<br><br>
Rinnosuke sighed.
<br><br>
"Yeah, pretty much. Garbage. ...Huh? This laptop's got some kind of printer thing on it. Do lappies like this even exist?"
<br><br>
Sumireko moved to pick up a large, oddly-shaped laptop with a small screen, which she'd never seen before.
<br><br>
"That's a fairly stupid question. It's existing on the table right in front of you."
<br><br>
"Hmm... huh?! Gah, heavy! This thing's way too chunky! I've literally never seen a lappy like this!"
<br><br>
"You haven't? So it's your first time seeing it as well, then. Incidentally, it happens to be known as a 'word processor'-- a 'WorPro' for short. We practically have mountains of them in stock." 
<br><br>
Rinnosuke had the ability to recognize any object's name just by looking at it. Sumireko, however, seemed puzzled even after hearing its name.
<br><br>
"A WorPro...? What the heck is that?"
<br><br>
"You've never heard of them? They're a type of machine that can write text."
<br><br>
Rinnosuke also had the ability to recognize an object's purpose just by looking at it. However, despite his boastful tone, he had no idea how to use the object in practice or what it was truly worth.
<br><br>
"Write text? Practically any computer can do that. A 'WorPro', though... hmm. I could swear I've heard that name before somewhere. Studied it in school, maybe..."
<br><br>
Sumireko took out her smartphone and attempted to search for the term, but grimaced upon remembering that she was well out of service range.
<br><br>
"...I'll look it up when I get back home."
<br><br>
---About half a day later, most of the computers in the shop had colored paper attached to them. No matter who you asked, they'd agree that most of the paper was clearly red.
<br><br>
"...So, the red ones are worthless. You're better off just throwing them out or whatever. Blue ones are probably still usable. And white means you should keep them in reserve."
<br><br>
"I see... So they're almost all worthless, then. That's a relief; I can dispose of the excess stock without having to worry about it. Thank you very much. You're the only person who could've done this job."
<br><br>
"Um, so... this is a job, right?"
<br><br>
"Mm? Yes, of course. It's very valuable work."
<br><br>
Sumireko fidgeted, as if working up the nerve to say something.
<br><br>
"So then, like. Uh. In that caaase. Don't I get something for it?"
<br><br>
Sumireko made the "money" gesture again, still fidgeting.
<br><br>
"Erm... Ah. I see. You want a reward for it."
<br><br>
"I-I mean, yeah! But! C'mon, you don't have to call payment for services a 'reward!' It's a wage, if anything! A paycheck! A sa-la-ry!"
<br><br>
"...Yes, all right, I'm sorry for not assuming that you'd want any wages for it. So, how much do you want?"
<br><br>
Sumireko paused. She'd never worked at an actual job, and New Year's gifts were just about the only form of money she'd personally received. Whenever she wanted something, she simply had her parents buy it for her. And she certainly wasn't able to picture a price estimate for her services without relying on an internet search.
<br><br>
"W-well, how much might you be able to give me? For this appraisal job."
<br><br>
Rinnosuke opened a drawer, pulled out several slips of paper, and gave it some thought. Sumireko, meanwhile, was less interested in the number of bills in his hand than she was in the appearance of said bills. The things seemed to be paper currency, and yet not, at the same time.
<br><br>
"What are those?"
<br><br>
"Sumireko... You wanted payment, and yet you don't even know what this is? It's money."
<br><br>
"Money? Well, I figured as much... But what era is that from?"
<br><br>
"...Ah. This ought to be money from the Outside World, but I suppose if you're unfamiliar with it, it must be a type that they've already stopped using."
<br><br>
"You're telling me that this is what Gensokyo uses for money? Who is this?!"
<br><br>
Sumireko's interest had now shifted from the first paycheck of her life to the unfamiliar portraits pictured on the bills. Though she'd never seen any of them, many of them seemed oddly familiar. It was enough to make her dizzy.
<br><br>
...As always, she began to hear her phone's alarm gently raising its volume.
<br><br>
That gently-flowing, nothing-but-courteous melody woke Sumireko up. Its soothing tone ate away at her mind. She always felt terrible after waking up, as her trips to Gensokyo took place in her dreams. Since she was more active in her dreams than in real life, sleeping didn't ease her fatigue in the slightest.
<br><br>
Today was different, though. She remembered that she'd brought something she wanted to investigate out of her dream along with her. Sumireko grabbed her phone from beside her pillow and began to type, but quickly stopped, heaved herself out of bed, and opened up her laptop on her desk. Though she usually used her phone to search for things, whenever she intended to really seriously investigate something, she opted to use her laptop instead.
<br><br>
"...WorPros, WorPros... Aha. Yeah, gotcha. They're those machines that just type letters, the ones that people used before computers were an everyday thing. I knew I'd heard about them before! I just didn't remember! ...'TRAGIC: Kids these days don't even know what a WorPro is!' No, god, I knew about them, I just couldn't remember, thank you. Jerks."
<br><br>
Sumireko laughed scornfully.
<br><br>
"...'Production of WorPros has since ceased, and nowadays only certain hobbyists tend to deal in them...' Hm. Might be able to get some good value for it as an antique..."
<br><br>
She muttered this without really caring about it, and set to investigating her next point of interest. Namely, the bills with the unfamiliar portraits. She compared the pictures she'd taken with her phone to the image search results.
<br><br>
"Is it this one...? 'Yamato Takeru.' That's, uhh-- I know I've heard of that guy before, but wasn't he a video game character or something? So they must've made bills with that character on them. Let's see, about how much would they be worth now..."
<br><br>
She gazed sternly at the search results.
<br><br>
---Kourindou, some days later. A very excited Sumireko was staring Rinnosuke right in the eye.
<br><br>
"Yamato! Um, bills with Yamato Takeru on them! Are worth a huge amount!"
<br><br>
"A-are they, now?"
<br><br>
"Yes! But they're basically just chump change in Gensokyo, right? So if you went and exchanged these in reality, you'd make SO much cash!"
<br><br>
"...I see. What you're saying does make certain sense."
<br><br>
"And there's probably a ton of other bills hiding in here that would be worth a lot. Hey... d'you want me to go cash these in for you?"
<br><br>
In contrast to Sumireko's fervor, Rinnosuke was entirely calm.
<br><br>
"I suppose that's true... But what difference would it make, exactly, if you had more money in the Outside World?"
<br><br>
"Huh? Well, the more money you've got, the better stuff you can buy, the better food you can treat yourself to... and, uhh."
<br><br>
"What a shallow idea. The Outside World's money is utterly worthless to Gensokyo."
<br><br>
"It is? ...But, it might be an old bill and all, but you are using Yamato Takeru's 1000-yen notes. Doesn't that mean that the bills have value to them after all?"
<br><br>
"We're using them, true. If I may elaborate, we use many bills other than Yamato Takeru's on a daily basis as well. But we're just recycling whatever paper currency happens to drift into Gensokyo. As far as we're concerned, paper bills are just promissory notes that are impossible to copy. The sums written and portraits drawn on them don't have any particular value on their own."
<br><br>
"...? Mind explaining a bit further?"
<br><br>
"Gensokyo essentially operates on the bartering system. As such, the Outside World's bills are nothing more than items for exchange that are easy to carry around. The price of a bill is determined by the asking price given when it's exchanged, and the bill itself has no fixed value to it. In the first place, who do you think could assign a universal value to a mere scrap of paper like that?"
<br><br>
Sumireko was silent for several moments, as she seemed to have difficulty comprehending the topic. Rinnosuke then posed a question, in a rather loquacious fashion.
<br><br>
"Let's say someone convinced people that there was some innate value to a scrap of paper that originally had none, and in so doing, they ended up granting said value to it. The only person who could do something like that would be God, or an utter villain pretending to be God. Which do you think it is?"
<br><br>
"...There's no such thing as God. So, basically, anyone making paper money is a supervillain?"
<br><br>
"Correct indeed. If you want evidence, just think about it: the more evil someone is, the more they want to hoard more money than they'd ever need, right? Even though it's all just scraps of paper."
<br><br>
"Oh, true..."
<br><br>
"Heh. You're well-suited for a job like this."
<br><br>
Sumireko found herself agreeing before she realized it, though she still didn't really understand.
<br><br>
"So then, does that make it evil to work for money too?"
<br><br>
Rinnosuke shook his head, and took on a somewhat sullen expression.
<br><br>
"No, absolutely not. It's perfectly appropriate to choose money as payment for your work. The thing that villains do-- the thing that's truly immoral-- is to attach real value to paper currency. Making people believe nonsense like 'this slip of paper is worth enough to buy an entire house!', and distributing it as such."
<br><br>
"Oh, I get it. Yeah, that would seem like some kind of scam."
<br><br>
Sumireko nodded, and seemed to decide upon something.
<br><br>
"Hey, Rinnosuke. I think I'd like to be a part-timer here after all. I can appraise things from the Outside World, and the like."
<br><br>
"Part-timer...? Ah, you mean doing favors around the store."
<br><br>
"No! Not 'favors'. I mean working here."
<br><br>
Sumireko wanted to do work as an independent adult. Not as 'favors' and 'rewards,' but as skilled labor and payment for it.
<br><br>
"Alright. I'm not exactly sure what the difference is... but that'll help. Excess stock of unfamiliar items has been quite an issue for me lately, after all. So, what would you like for your rewar... your payment, rather? As I just explained, money has different value between Gensokyo and the Outside World, so exchanging one for the other is pointless."
<br><br>
"...How about this? I take back one of those worthless tools that you'd otherwise dispose of, and that'll be my wages. Payment in kind, right? Just like how it works everywhere else in Gensokyo."
<br><br>
Rinnosuke hemmed and hawed over it for a moment, then ultimately agreed.
<br><br>
---Several days later.
<br><br>
Reimu and Marisa were making conversation at the Hakurei Shrine.
<br><br>
"Huh? Sumireko's working at Kourindou?"
<br><br>
"Yep! Seems like she's an official employee down there."
<br><br>
"Wow. I did get the sense that she admired having a job somehow, but a do-nothing job like that...? I guess she just wanted to have fun with it, in the end."
<br><br>
"Yup. I sure don't think they're doing any actual work down at that place... but, y'know, it's alright this way too, don'tcha think?"
<br><br>
Marisa gave Reimu a serious look.
<br><br>
"Hmm. Yeah, I guess it does save me a lot of trouble. It's good that Sumireko's spending more time at Kourindou. It'll make monitoring her that much easier."
<br><br>
One of Reimu's secret duties was to monitor Sumireko. She was a human from the Outside World, and one with immeasurable power on top of that. From Reimu's perspective, Sumireko's very presence was its own incident in progress, so she had been casually monitoring Sumireko in a way that seemed natural to onlookers.
<br><br>
"Speakin' of somethin' else. Have ya heard about those creepy cards that've been making the rounds down in the streets lately?"
<br><br>
"Cards? Oh, those. I've heard about them too; it looks like some youkai are telling each other rumors about them. Something about how even though they've just got these bizarre little pictures drawn on them, people are dealing in them all over the place?"
<br><br>
"'S a relief to know that you know about 'em too. Yeah, they say that some of those cards are being sold with totally unfair prices attached to 'em... It's like someone's giving 'em those prices. Pretty creepy stuff. Scary, if you ask me."
<br><br>
"...I'll keep an eye out for whether it's just a passing fad, or an incident."
<br><br>
---Kourindou, my usual place of peace and relaxation.
<br><br>
Sumireko was hard at work, as she'd promised.
<br><br>
She tended to shout out things like "man, this takes me back!" or "I've never seen this before!" as she took stock of the store's inventory, but she was still aiding me. It felt as if she was taking care of work that only she could deal with.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, as I happened to take one of our newly-stocked items in hand, I felt an indescribable terror.
<br><br>
"Ey, boss! We've got a real piece of work over here! We'll have to send it in to the appraisal team! ...Uh, boss? What's that?"
<br><br>
"'Boss'...? Well, whatever. It's nothing, really; you can just go back to your work."
<br><br>
I moved to put the mysterious paper scrap away in a drawer.
<br><br>
"Oh, but now I'm interested! What might it be? As far as your loyal employee can tell, it just seems to be a regular card, but..."
<br><br>
"It just looks like a regular card to me, too. But these are secretly being sold at absolutely ridiculous prices. I can only imagine that someone's deliberately manipulating their value."
<br><br>
I told one lie, just now. I didn't actually think that it was a regular card. How should I put it... Given the work that I do, I've handled a lot of cursed items, tsukumogami, magic items, and so forth. But this card isn't quite like any of those. It's like-- I can sense that it's got a very strong power contained within it, but I can't imagine what on Earth that might mean.
<br><br>
"Come onnn, let me seee. --Wait, doesn't this belong to Reimucchi?"
<br><br>
"Huh? What makes you say that?"
<br><br>
"No, like, this card's just got a-- a shrine-maideny feel to it. It's just that vibe she's always got to her. Plus, the yin-yang orb drawn on it makes it kind of obvious..."
<br><br>
It feels "Reimu-ey"? To think that she'd blindly trust in her own senses. Perhaps she might actually be someone of ridiculous talent. Though I typically choose to rely on my knowledge base, I somewhat-ashamedly decided to take her up on the topic.
<br><br>
"Sumireko, I was just thinking the same thing. I was lying a moment ago, but I don't actually think this is any ordinary card. There's got to be someone out there who's trying to attach value to these ordinary  paper scraps."
<br><br>
"In other words, there's some supervillain out there trying to control people's sense of value with these things! This is what Reimucchi would call an incident, right? Right?!"
<br><br>
Sumireko spoke with a palpable air of interest. I laughed, thinking it couldn't be something that serious.
<br><br>
---In no time at all, the mysterious cards had taken over all of Gensokyo. By the time the shrine maiden began to do something about it, popular opinion was that she'd left it sitting for far too long.
<br><br>
Even so, once she set out to resolve an incident, it would happen without any difficulty, and the only thing echoing throughout Gensokyo would be the famous shrine maiden's name.
<br><br>
It was then that I realized it all over again. I had noticed this abnormal change in people's sense of value from the very begining. I'd been well aware of the presence of someone manipulating the value of things from the shadows, and of the fact that they'd brought about the incident...!
<br><br>
