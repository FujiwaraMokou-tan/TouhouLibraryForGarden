"Ugh, it's so hot in this store. Don't you have an air conditioner or something?"
<br><br>
The customer flapped a fan in a dramatic fashion.
<br><br>
"Umm, is it really that hot?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it is. The outside feels cooler here than it is over there, but the inside is much hotter since there's no air conditioner. Well, assuming you know what that even is."
<br><br>
So said the customer relaxing in my store, a human from the outside world. Apparently, she is somehow able to come to Gensokyo in her dreams, and usually hangs around the shrine or my store.
<br><br>
"Then why don't you bring me this air conditioner that is so common in your world?"
<br><br>
"Uh-uh, it's not like I can just go to sleep while hugging an air conditioner. Not to mention they come in two parts, one that goes outside and the other inside."
<br><br>
In truth, I knew what air conditioners were because they had come through my store in the past. I had seen with my ability that they were machines that could blow not only cold air but also hot air, but as always I had no idea how you were supposed to use them. When I asked Ms. Usami about it, she turned me down, saying that she wasn't familiar with their workings and the installation procedure, and that they wouldn't work without an outdoor unit, or electricity, anyway.
<br><br>
"By the way, have you been to the shrine today? "
<br><br>
"No, I haven't."
<br><br>
"I see. Reimu has told me often that you should go over to the shrine whenever you visit, just in case."
<br><br>
"All right. Well, since today I came for other reasons than just exploring Gensokyo, I'll go after I finish that up."
<br><br>
"...Another meeting?"
<br><br>
My name is Rinnosuke Morichika. I'm the shopkeeper of the curio store, "Kourindou".
<br><br>
Though I say curio store, it doesn't just have ordinary tools and antiques, but also deals in items from the outside world.
<br><br>
She was being observed by various people. If something happened to her and the outside world found out about Gensokyo, it would be a serious matter, and conversely there was also the possibility of her bringing something detrimental into Gensokyo. Of course, Reimu was already considering putting her under strict supervision. However, as Sumireko hates being restrained, she's been appearing in several locations. That was why her arrival at the store would mean she was most likely meeting up with someone, unbeknownst to Reimu.
<br><br>
"Would you be meeting the mountain hermit again?"
<br><br>
"That's right. If it were anyone else I could just meet them at the shrine."
<br><br>
"It seems that hermit is requesting a lot of things from you."
<br>
<br>
"Yeah..."
<br>
<br>
She started playing with her smartphone as if she didn't want to be questioned any further, so I decided to stop my inquiry.
<br>
<br>
The mountain hermit was the one known as Ibarakasen. It seemed she would descend upon the shrine on occasion to educate Reimu, so I did not know why she was keeping her meetings with a person from the outside world secret from her.
<br>
<br>
According to what I have heard, she would make requests such as procuring cherry anthias from the outside or cheering up Reimu when she's feeling down.
<br>
<br>
Sumireko was growing surprisingly close to those that were not human. Normal outsiders (humans that came to Gensokyo from the outside world) would most likely have lost their minds by now, but because she either had a lot of nerve or a few screws loose already, it seemed like she had lived here all of her life.
<br>
<br>
*Ring-a-ling*
<br>
<br>
"She's here. It's the hermit."
<br>
<br>
Ibarakasen. With one arm tightly wrapped in bandages and the other connected to a chain, she emanated an aura of iniquity, but her demeanor was gentle. Whether humans or youkai, she would treat all with kindness.
<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting in such a hot place."
<br>
<br>
"The wait wasn't that long, but it really is hot."
<br>
<br>
"It's because there are so many unsold items that this store has poor ventilation."
<br>
<br>
Though I wondered if it was truly that hot, it was undeniable that recently the ventilation had been poor. If these freeloaders would simply buy a few goods, then the ventilation would improve.
<br>
<br>
The two began their conversation, taking no notice of me, the proprietor. So as to not eavesdrop on their conversation, I moved further away and opened up a book.
<br>
<br>
—Some time later...
<br>
<br>
"We're done. Thanks again, Keeper of the Meeting Place."
<br>
<br>
"Who are you calling "Keeper of the Meeting Place"? ...And where's Ms. Usami?"
<br>
<br>
"She's already left."
<br>
<br>
"Quick as always, isn't she? Doesn't even say goodbye."
<br>
<br>
"She always disappears suddenly because she leaves when she wakes up, after all. She can only spend about forty, fifty minutes here at a time."
<br>
<br>
"If she's entering the dream world as soon as she goes to sleep, then that's quite a short sleeping period."
<br>
<br>
"Well, it is midday, after all..."
<br>
<br>
Ibarakasen laughed as if she was a little amazed. It was only natural, since it was rather strange for someone to be sleeping so often in the middle of the day.
<br>
<br>
"By the way, what did you request from her this time?"
<br>
<br>
"My, didn't I tell you that you're better off not asking if you want to live long?"
<br><br>
"Well, I'm not too interested in living long. And wouldn't that be a fair payment for making use of this meeting place?"
<br><br>
"...Hmm, I don't think I can do so in this case."
<br><br>
"That's fine. I'll just ask Ms. Usami."
<br>
<br>
"If you would do that, then be my guest."
<br><br>
"...? Anyway, there's something that I've been curious about since a while ago..."
<br><br>
What I had been curious about was how Ms. Usami had come to be this hermit's errand girl.
<br><br>
"Hmm, errand girl, you say? Is that what it looks like?"
<br><br>
"I can't help but think that you've figured out her weakness or something. Haven't you made a lot of requests that don't seem to hold any merit for her, like procuring objects from the outside world?"
<br><br>
Ibarakasen thought for a bit.
<br><br>
"...Indeed, you could say that I know her weakness. I can't tell you anything about today's request, but as payment for using this meeting place I'll tell you about the incident she caused around her last year.
<br><br>
Ibarakasen began to tell her story. To me, who had little interest in battles, it was a story full of yet unknown truths.
<br><br>
—The incident that had caused Sumireko to start appearing in Gensokyo occurred around this time last year.
<br><br>
She had learned about Gensokyo in the outside world and entered it using her own power. However, it was difficult to fully penetrate the powerful barrier from outside. To counteract this, she entered partially and laid a trap that would cause someone to weaken the barrier from the inside. Her plan was only half successful, and now she can only be in Gensokyo in her dreams by materializing in an incomplete form.
<br><br>
"Now I understand. So it was due to her trap that the commotion about Occult Balls that I saw even outside my store occurred, right?"
<br>
"Right. The Occult Balls were a crystallization of the lack of common sense in the outside world, so they were irregular objects that could disrupt the boundary of common sense that formed the Great Barrier."
<br><br>
The Great Barrier had been created such that common sense was kept outside, while the lack of it was kept inside. If some contradictory object that was not supported by common sense but yet existed in the outside world tried to penetrate the barrier, then it would threaten its very existence.
<br><br>
"I see. I would've liked to see one of those Occult Balls."
<br><br>
"If you had managed to obtain one of them, then maybe it would have been less trouble, thinking in hindsight."
<br><br>
"Does being the owner of a curio store that deals with goods from the outside world make me some sort of special, superior being?"
<br><br>
"You can tell the name and usage of something just by looking at it, can't you? Then perhaps you would have been able to see through the trap as well."
<br><br>
"That certainly could have been the case. ...Ah, I know what it is now."
<br><br>
"What?"
<br><br>
"It's because of disturbance over the Occult Balls that Ms. Usami can't stand up to you. Am I right?
<br>
<br>
"Ah, um, well, that's not exactly it..."<br>
<br>
Soon after, Ibarakasen left, and the shop returned to its usual state of lone emptiness.
<br><br>
I would never have guessed that the powerless-looking Ms. Usami had tried to destroy Gensokyo's barrier, and half succeeded at that. However, I now understood the reason for Reimu's and Ibarakasen's excessive meddling. They were not protecting her from the dangerous youkai in Gensokyo, or preventing an incident from occurring, but that they were observing someone who could potentially act with ill intentions.
<br><br>
I thought that she had adapted to Gensokyo with extreme ease, but I suppose it was obvious for someone who always wanted to come here.
<br><br>
—"Ring-a-ling"
<br><br>
"Huh? Has Kasenny already left?"
<br>
<br>
"'Kasenny'? W-well, yes, but why are you back so soon?"
<br><br>
In less than an hour, Ms. Usami had come to the store again.
<br>
<br>
"Hmm, I just wanted to discuss something with her for a bit. I was woken up earlier since it was time for lunch, but now my afternoon classes have started, I came back."
<br><br>
"I'm a little worried about you sleeping so frequently during the day. By the way, Ibarakasen told me that I could ask you about her earlier request, so if you don't mind..."
<br><br>
"You mean what we just talked about? Hmm, I dunno... Ah, but if Kasenny didn't tell you..."
<br><br>
For some reason, she seemed happy.
<br><br>
"The truth is, it was actually my turn to request something from Kasenny this time."
<br><br>
"Huh?"
<br><br>
"You see, it might have seemed like I was the one that was always taking jobs for her, but it wasn't that one-sided. We actually agreed to trade off on who makes requests, and it was my turn to ask this time.
<br><br>
In Gensokyo, hermits were beings that were respected to an extent. Considering that there was supposed to be a huge gap between the humans and the hermits, it was possible that this outsider was more important than I had assumed. She had been trading requests under equal conditions with a hermit. Moreover, to think she was calling her by a personal nickname... I had heard rumors, but these "female high-school students" are terrifying. I wonder if it was true that they didn't even fear death.
<br><br>
"I-I see. That's why Ibarakasen needed your permission when I asked her about the request."
<br><br>
"As for the request itself... well, it's a little silly. I just asked her to guide me around Gensokyo's occult spots. And she told me that she would have everything ready if I waited until next week."
<br><br>
"I see. It is a little silly, but... I wonder where Gensokyo's occult spots are supposed to be."
<br><br>
"I actually asked her first to install an air conditioner at this meeting place because of how hot it was, but she turned it down, saying that was beyond her powers."
<br><br>
"Oho, I would be quite grateful for an air conditioner in my ...Wait, this isn't a meeting place!"
<br><br>
I learned that last year, strange urban legends had manifested and ancient occult happenings were widespread. I also learned that the Occult Balls had appeared and that Ms. Usami was in her current condition because of the resulting calamity. However, I had heard from the hermit earlier that the Occult Balls were separate from the occult happenings.
<br><br>
As proof, even if the Occult Balls had disappeared, the occult happenings were continuing to spread instead of settling down. And a person had appeared that could control the occult freely.
<br><br>
It was possible that, seeing the occult run rampant in Gensokyo, Ms. Usami could concoct some terrifying scheme. I tried asking about this indirectly.
<br><br>
"What do you plan on doing by visiting Gensokyo's occult spots?"
<br><br>
"Well, you see, I'm the president of the Sealing Club, which is basically like an Occult Club. That's what I'm interested in."
<br><br>
"Couldn't Gensokyo itself be considered occult from an outside world point of view?"
<br><br>
"...I guess that's true."
<br><br>
With her mumbled words, I was certain of some ulterior motive.
<br><br>
"Does your attachment to the occult have something to do with the situation you're in right now?"
<br><br>
"I definitely can't argue with that, and I do want to do something about how I can only visit Gensokyo in my dreams. I know that the occult is changing the world of Gensokyo, so I thought that if I could figure out why the occult was manifesting, I could change my situation, too. And maybe I'd even be able to enter Gensokyo in a complete form."
<br><br>
Sumireko was very intelligent. It was possible that she knew more about the structure of the occult than anyone else in Gensokyo. She talked about occult matters from the outside world too -- phenomena that spread artificially, others which were sure to be lurking in the latest technology, and even those that developed their own characters.
<br><br>
That was because instead of believing in the occult, she thought that a thorough understanding of it was the best way to avoid its effects, hence her research, as she said. It was a notion absent from all of Gensokyo's residents.
<br><br>
Her occult theories even covered Gensokyo's occult crisis, and she even made the prediction that it was being caused by some third party, and in the near future there would be a destructive wave coming using the power of the occult.
<br><br>
She was strangely persuasive, to the point that I felt if we were too careless, she would be the key that would tear through the barrier of Gensokyo, making it a part of the occult of the outside world.
<br><br>
After a week had passed, she and the hermit went on a tour of Gensokyo's occult spots one night as promised. It seemed they visited places such as the temple's graveyard and the shrine, and some more unusual places such as the mansion on the lake and Youkai Mountain. Apparently, Ibarakasen had asked others to play roles representing occult phenomena at each spot to frighten her, making it a test of courage with the VIP treatment of guaranteed safety.
<br><br>
Hearing this, I laughed to imagine Sumireko's disappointed expression as she thought about how she did not want such a farce.
