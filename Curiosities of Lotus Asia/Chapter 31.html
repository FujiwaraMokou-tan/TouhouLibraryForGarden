"So listen to this. People are going to the zoo together during summer break even in high school! They're all so childish, it's awful."
</p><p>
"Oh? The zoo, you say? I've read about those. Something about how they're 'Human-centric facilities that make animals live their whole lives in captivity in the name of conservation', I think?"
</p><p>
"Um... What kind of books are you reading?"
</p><p>
With a chilly breeze and cirrocumulus clouds framing the depth of the sky, the Hakurei Shrine was deeply into autumn.
</p><p>
Sumireko Usami was idly chatting with Marisa Kirisame while they both waited for the head of the shrine to return.
</p><p>
"Oh right, so Gensokyo doesn't have any zoos, does it? Makes sense. It'd be kinda cool if it did though."
</p><p>
"I like to go see it if it did."
</p><p>
Sumireko wondered which animals would be the most popular in a zoo in Gensokyo. They may be classics, but she couldn't picture them being delighted by herbivores like elephants and giraffes. This may just be her own bias, but she felt they'd be best suited for carnivores. She imagined humans unafraid of youkai beasts trembling in fear at the sight of lions and cheetahs.
</p><p>
"Hey Marisacchi, what animal would you like to see, if you went to a zoo?"
</p><p>
"Hmm, let me think... I guess it's gotta be a panda."
</p><p>
"Huh?"
</p><p>
"Did I remember the name? You know, that big, black and white, fluffy-looking thing."
</p><p>
"No, that's definitely a panda. I'm just surprised."
</p><p>
"Why? There ain't any other animal so huge yet adorable. Like, they don't even know how to live in the wild. Ain't zoos places that are supposed to preserve animals like that?"
</p><p>
"I think you might have a distorted view of what zoos are... But when I said I was surprised, I just meant that I figured you'd like some... stronger kind of animal. Like lions or cheetahs."
</p><p>
"Lions are basically like tigers, right? There's someone who owns a tiger so I see 'em now and then, and we're swarming with wolves around here. Besides, youkai beasts are way more ferocious than most of these things, so I guess I'm just sick of fighting predators."
</p><p>
"Sick of fighting predators. Now that's a fresh perspective."
</p><p>
That's when they saw Reimu Hakurei running towards them from the shrine's torii gates.
</p><p>
"Rinnosuke's looking for you, Sumireko. It didn't sound urgent, so you should head there later."
</p><p>
"Fine, I got it. Maybe he's confused about how to use some new machine again."
</p><p>
"Probably. He's always been pretty awful at machines, even though he runs a secondhand good shop."
</p><p>
Rinnosuke Morichika, the owner of the store Kourindou, has the power to know an object's name and purpose. It appears that lately he's been relying on Sumireko to explain any unfamiliar tools.
</p><p>
"Anyway, sorry for changing the subject Reimucchi, but what kind of animal would you like to see if you could visit a zoo?
</p><p>
"A zoo, huh? You mean a place like that mountain hermit's mansion?"
</p><p>
"Whoa, is that what the hermit's place is like?"
</p><p>
"Yeah, she keeps all kinds of beasts, like eagles and tigers and other meat eaters."
</p><p>
Sumireko imagined a hermit taking care of animals.
</p><p>
"No, Reimu, zoos are places that preserve animals that would naturally-"
</p><p>
Sumireko covered Marisa's mouth.
</p><p>
"That's wrong too. Zoos are exciting places that gather up unusual animals from all across the world. So you'd be able to see animals that don't live in Gensokyo."
</p><p>
"Animals from outside Gensokyo, huh? Then it's gotta be pandas for me. Or Mr. Elephant with the long nose."
</p><p>
"Yup. For sure." Marisa added her approval.
</p><p>
"I was dimly aware of this before, but... You two have the same knowledge of animals as a preschooler, don't you?"
</p><p>
Kourindou. A secondhand goods shop in Gensokyo. It mainly deals in items that wash up in Gensokyo from the outside world.
</p><p>
Rinnosuke was worrying over a strange item he happened to get ahold of.
</p><p>
By appearance it looked like a plush animal, but it was made of a hard material and no matter how he tried he couldn't see it as cute. It was an eerie four-legged machine not unlike a dog, and while it seemed to have some sort of consciousness, its facial expressions absolutely could not be read.
</p><p>
He understood that it was a dog-shaped robot used as a pet. And he could easily imagine how it would be used as a pet. It was a robot made for people who wanted to avoid taking care of a dog, for whatever reason. Probably for religious reasons.
</p><p>
However, that wasn't what bothered him. Unless Sumireko arrived soon and taught him how to use it, he wouldn't be able to relax.
</p><p>
The bell on the door swayed in the breeze, but the sound he was waiting for never came.
</p><p>
At the Hakurei shrine, the conversation about animals had fully bloomed.
</p><p>
"Whoa, so what we call wolves are extinct in the outside world?"
</p><p>
"Yup. So from my perspective, the fact that they're ordinary in Gensokyo is... wait, are there otters too?"
</p><p>
"You see them all the time down by the river. They like to play with the kappa."
</p><p>
"I knew it. Actually, otters are extinct in Japan too."
</p><p>
"So in the outside world, so they have so little food that they needed to hunt the otters to extinction?" Marisa put on a grim face.
</p><p>
"I'm pretty sure it wasn't because of over-hunting... It think their natural habitat was destroyed. There weren't enough places for them to live, or something like that. There just wasn't nearly enough diversity.
</p><p>
"I see. So it was diversity after all?"
</p><p>
"Makes sense. It's always that danged diversity."
</p><p>
It appeared that the two, no, three of them had no idea what diversity meant.
</p><p>
"Speaking of wolves and otters though, them and the other animals put us through a real tough time recently."
</p><p>
"Reimucchi, worried about damage caused by animals? That's a new one."
</p><p>
"Not just ordinary animals, I'm talking about ones from Hell. No, wait, the Animal Realm."
</p><p>
Reimu summarized the incredibly bizarre animal war that had occurred over the summer.
</p><p>
The animals of the Animal Realm are all managed as the slaves of organizations, and they fight an endless, purposeless war in the name of corporate growth. Humans are treated even worse, locked up in a facility called the "Primate Garden" in the name of protection, artificially prolonging their extinction. Reimu had fought the god idolized by the humans of the Primate Garden while possessed by an animal spirit.
</p><p>
But not even that god could be called an ally of humanity, and obviously not of the animals either. In the animals realm, everyone treated anything as permissible if it would help them win. A world ruined by "survival of the fittest."
</p><p>
"A-Animals formed organizations and protected humans...?"
</p><p>
"Animal spirits. We're talking about spirits here. The power balance between spirits is completely different from the power balance of flesh and blood animals, so it's no surprise if you don't get it."
</p><p>
"But this is a whole new otherworld, other than Gensokyo. I think I'm getting a little curious."
</p><p>
"Whoa there, even if you're curious, you really shouldn't go, for your own sake. The people there will seriously use anything or anyone. I'm scared to even imagine what they'd do if they found a human from the outside world. There might be spirits who hold a grudge for their buddies getting slaughtered, or even for them being kept alive in zoos cuz of that. Maybe they'll even keep you alive for eternity outside the wheel of reincarnation, for some even more terrifying reason."
</p><p>
Sumireko shuddered. When she thought about animals retaining their consciousness after death and making a human-like world, the fact that humans were on the bottom of the hierarchy was no surprise. And if she started seeing zoos from that perspective, she felt like she'd be even less able to casually enjoy the zoo with her friends.
</p><p>
"But still, it's pretty worrying. Those Animal Realm animal organizations must be up to something in Gensokyo, because they keep inching closer and closer. It's pretty hard to turn away the ones with no hostility."
</p><p>
"Oh? So I might end up meeting one of those animals from the Animal Realm, huh? I'd better be careful..."
</p><p>
Kourindou, the next day.
</p><p>
I was completely and utterly exhausted.
</p><p>
This too was of course due to the mysterious pet-type robot. As long as I didn't know how to use it, I wouldn't be able to sleep, even at night.
</p><p>
"Ha ha ha! So you don't know how to use this robot, huh?"
</p><p>
"Precisely. Thanks to this thing, I've lost all my peace and quiet."
</p><p>
Sumireko was laughing. Seeing this, I became a little uneasy.
</p><p>
"It's a pet robot. You don't use it. It's easier and safer to take care of than a real pet... really a pet for humans. It's just a thing, I mean, a pet, that you look at and love."
</p><p>
"I just need to love it? Absurd. This robot wanders around 24 hours a day, destroying my precious merchandise. If I try to lock it up it somehow escapes, and if I kick it out it ends up back in here before I know it. The reason I called you here is less to learn how to use it, but more how to stop it."
</p><p>
"Don't be ridiculous. It's a little sad, but it's just a robot so if you cut off the power it'll stop. Let's see... where's the switch...?"
</p><p>
Sumireko wrestled with the robot. It looked as though she were being attacked by an unidentified creature.
</p><p>
"The power switch doesn't work. Maybe it's buggy? Then we'll have to take out the batteries..."
</p><p>
Sumireko continued wrestling. Seeing her so perplexed after she'd treated me as a fool was somehow calming
</p><p>
"Okay, got the battery out. Now it should be-"
</p><p>
The pet robot leapt to its feet, and perhaps because it was lighter now without the battery, ran circles around Sumireko.
</p><p>
"Wh-What's going on?! It's moving without any power! I-Is it a ghost?!"
</p><p>
Upon being rushed by the robot moving without any driving force, Sumireko fainted.
</p><p>
"Oh, I see. So I shouldn't have consulted Sumireko, but the Hakurei Shrine."
</p><p>
Reimu had set up a barrier around Kourindou.
</p><p>
That said, it was merely wrapped with a shimenawa. Perhaps this would be able to stop youkai, but a robot is a different matter. From here on, Reimu would be performing history's first ever robot warding.
</p><p>
Sumireko seemed to have hit her head a little, but she had completely recovered and was watching the robot with excitement. The robot itself was obediently idling in the center of the room.
</p><p>
"From my research, this pet robot was the very first model, and it's discontinued these days. It's no mystery how it ended up passing into fantasy."
</p><p>
Reimu carefully watched the robot. Somewhere along the way her expression had relaxed.
</p><p>
"I can definitely sense some kind of spirit..."
</p><p>
Reimu opened her palm and approached the robot. Its appearance was definitely that of a puppy.
</p><p>
"I-It's so cute... I mean, it seems to be a variety of tsukumogami."
</p><p>
Tsukumogami are tools that turned into youkai after a long time.
</p><p>
"But it doesn't sound like it's been around that long, and either way tsukumogami are born to take revenge on humans. This robot shows no sign of that."
</p><p>
"So what is it then?"
</p><p>
"All I can think of is that it was originally designed like this."
</p><p>
"You mean it's running off of just a backup battery? What an engineer's dream!"
</p><p>
Despite saying that, Sumireko immediately changed her mind.
</p><p>
"But no, I can't see that happening. The tools of the outside world aren't like magical tools. It's unthinkable that it'd still be moving so energetically after so long without power."
</p><p>
The robot ran around innocently. Perhaps because it lacked vocal cords, or maybe its speaker were broke, but it never made the slightest sound. This made it a little creepy.
</p><p>
"I guess the only other thing I can think of is that it's possessed by a spirit or something."
</p><p>
"And suddenly it turns to the occult!"
</p><p>
Sumireko was celebrating, but in Gensokyo dealing with spirit possession is an everyday occurrence. It's quite bothersome. If souls aren't dealt with properly, all that does is cause unforeseen secondary harm.
</p><p>
"First I'd like to figure out what kind of spirit you, and why you're possessing this. Well, since you're possessing a dog-shaped object and moving like a dog, I'm pretty sure you're a dog spirit."
</p><p>
Reimu mumbled as she held onto the adorable robot and smiled.
</p><p>
"...What is she doing?"
</p><p>
Sumireko whispered, so as not to disturb Reimu.
</p><p>
"Is she pretending to be communicating with the soul?"
</p><p>
"Pretending, huh?"
</p><p>
It probably didn't matter if someone who couldn't talk to spirits saw this as pretending. It's fine as long as we arrive at some arbitrary answer by any means. This wasn't the sort of thing we'd be checking to see if it's true.
</p><p>
"...Well, this is a surprise. I can't communicate with the spirit possessing it at all. We can't come to an understanding."
</p><p>
Reimu's expression became serious.
</p><p>
"Either it's not possessed and moving for some other reason, or the soul possessing it has some reason to hide its existence. Other than that, um..."
</p><p>
Reimu held her head in her arms. It looked like we weren't going to get a satisfactory explanation.
</p><p>
The well-maintained grounds gave a more modern impression than the Hakurei Shrine. Worshippers could also be glimpsed here and there.
</p><p>
Myouren Temple, a large temple near the human village. Despite its recent construction, the air it gave off was enough for some people call it an ancient temple.
</p><p>
The matter of the robot's soul being apparently beyond the Hakurei Shrine Maiden, I turned my hopes to the Myouren Temple. It was quite suitable, as they performed not only funerals, but memorial services for tools. Reimu had extremely reluctantly recommended coming here.
</p><p>
On seeing the pet robot, the chief priest, Byakuren Hijiri, immediately thought it was a request for a memorial service, but seemed to quickly realize that it wasn't.
</p><p>
"Where is this from?"
</p><p>
"The exact location is a trade secret, but there's a place where I often find tools from the outside world."
</p><p>
"I'm astonished. This is quite the unusual case. It's no surprise the shrine maiden was unable to communicate with the possessing spirit. This puppy is alive."
</p><p>
"Huh? Alive?"
</p><p>
"To be precise, I believe she's alive. Most likely, the spirit of a puppy given life in the world of the living ended up in this robot before it could be born, for whatever reason. What we would call reincarnation. From the dog's perspective, I'd imagine she woke up to find herself mysteriously moving the body of this robot. Rest assured, I sense no malice whatsoever. It's rare, but sometimes these things happen."
</p><p>
"I see. Thank you."
</p><p>
I wasn't quite sure what the difference was between this and spiritual possession, but the religious often spoke like this. If I'd asked probing questions about my doubts, I'd be digging myself into an even deeper grave. The wise choice is to avoid pursuing it any further.
</p><p>
"So, how would you like to proceed? Since you came to the temple, I assume you were considering a memorial service, but..."
</p><p>
"So that's what happened." Said Reimu.
</p><p>
Reimu and Sumireko had come to Kourindou to hear the details. The robot roamed freely within the store.
</p><p>
"So it's no different from a real, living dog. Holding a memorial service would be killing it, which is a bit much for me. Separating the soul from the robot would be the same thing too. I could never do that to an innocent puppy."
</p><p>
Reimu was nodding.
</p><p>
"But, well, it's not really like a real dog, is it? A real dog has to eat or it'll die. But this robot can move without any power, right? It doesn't need electricity, but what about food?"
</p><p>
Sumireko asked Reimu the most important question.
</p><p>
"If it works the same as a tsukumogami, it shouldn't need energy because it moves just from spiritual power. Spiritual power gets absorbed from nearby creatures or nature, I guess. So for this puppy, it'd be stealing it from Rinnosuke."
</p><p>
"I knew he seemed tired. Is that why?"
</p><p>
"That level of fatigue is just business as usual!" Everyone laughed.
</p><p>
"So anyway, you're planning on keeping her here, right? Have you decided on a name?"
</p><p>
"Huh? A name?"
</p><p>
"Everyone gives their pet a name! Should I name it then? Maybe something like Aibo?"
</p><p>
"No, please don't. I'll think of something. She's my pet, after all."
</p><p>
Eventually this robot dog who'd started out so rambunctious started learning to listen to what I said. Maybe she thought of me as her parent.
</p><p>
The sudden appearance of a pet caused a lot of trouble at first, but I slowly came to think of her as no different from an ordinary dog. Reimu had told me to be careful of animal spirits for the time being, but I wasn't even sure what I was supposed to be careful of exactly.
</p><p>
I decided to name her "Laika". Apparently this is the name of the outside world's most famous dog, as well as the dog that's experienced the most loneliness. She may be a robot dog living in the separate land called Gensokyo, but I don't intend to let her ever experience loneliness this time.
</p><p>
It would be nice if she eventually grew up to a watchdog for Kourindou, but maybe that's a bit much to ask of her robot body.
