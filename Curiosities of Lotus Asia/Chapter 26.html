<br>
A deep snow had fallen outside, and I was almost unable to see anything out the window. There was no one to shovel the snow off the path to the store. As a result, there were almost no visitors in winter, and business was poor.
<br><br>
However, today there had been a visitor that had arrived early on. That visitor was currently skimming through the books that were for sale.
<br><br>
"'The Flood of Fake News and Post-Truth'...[1] Seems like a hard book with lots of words I don't know. I wonder if something's going on in the outside world?"
<br><br>
"I don't know too well myself, but it seems that the person chosen to act as the president that oversees the world has changed, and this new person is desperate to pass off lies as truth, and there's a lot of chaos stemming from that."
<br><br>
"So it's like a power struggle, huh. The outside world seems to be falling into an unsightly state, just like Gensokyo."
<br><br>
Reimu was reading a magazine from the outside world. The contents included celebrity scandals, corruption in politics, health hazards, and slave labor by large companies—basically all articles that had nothing to do with the people of Gensokyo. This was apparently a form of magazine called a 'tabloid'.
<br><br>
"Just like Gensokyo? Are you saying that Gensokyo is in an unsightly state from a power struggle?"
<br><br>
"More or less. There are a lot more youkai trying to exert their influence over the Human Village, and while there hasn't been any open conflict, I get the feeling a lot of maneuvering has begun behind the scenes."
<br><br>
"For example?"
<br><br>
"The tengu and the tanuki have already shown their faces and are influencing the village, the rabbits and the kappa are selling their goods to the humans, and even the youkai temple and Miko's dojo seem like they're constantly planning to capture the hearts of the humans. I'm sure there are other youkai factions that are trying to move in secret, and I really have no idea where to start..."
<br><br>
Even as Reimu said that, she didn't seem to be too concerned. Rather, she seemed to be enjoying the power struggle.
<br><br>
She was really a freewheeling person, not tied down to anybody. She couldn't even be brought down by gravity. Of course, somebody so freewheeling had no reason to fear being controlled by anyone else. She would be able to view the power struggle from an objective standpoint, and enjoy it almost as if it were a game.
<br><br>
So I decided to ask a bit of a mean question.
<br><br>
"Ah, so such important things were taking place outside the store. But if Gensokyo were to fall under somebody's control... I wonder who'd be good as president?"
<br><br>
Reimu pondered this.
<br><br>
—Ring ring.
<br><br>
"Ah, it sure is cold. The snow is falling a lot harder."
<br><br>
A new visitor had arrived. It was the tengu reporter known as Aya Shameimaru. She did visit once in a while, but it was mainly to collect data or publicize her newspaper, and she rarely actually bought anything. To be honest she was a bit of a nuisance, but I was worried that if I treated her coldly, she would write bad things about the store in her newspaper.
<br><br>
"Please make sure to clean off the snow on your clothes before you enter the store."
<br><br>
"Oh, Reimu... Hm, I see, I see."
<br><br>
As if she had stumbled across some interesting material, Aya began to take pictures of Reimu. It seemed Reimu was accustomed to having her picture taken, as she didn't take any notice.
<br><br>
"By the way, have any new goods arrived?"
<br><br>
"That again? Does the increase in items from the outside world really bother you that much?"
<br><br>
"Yes. You see, I'm very interested in your source of supply."
<br><br>
Recently, I've had more opportunities to obtain items from the outside world. Needless to say, that was the work of one Miss Usami, but due to it I ended up being relentlessly pursued by this reporter.
<br><br>
"How many times do I have to say it? It was the foreigner, Miss Usami—"
<br><br>
I cut myself off. I was supposed to be keeping Miss Usami's visits to this store a secret from Reimu. However, the reporter responded in a loud voice, as if wanting Reimu to overhear her.
<br><br>
"Ah, I remember. The foreigner brought them in for you, didn't she? Wow, it's incredible that you have a direct link to the outside world now. To try and bring in new outside forces to Gensokyo, which has grown so much in its insular state, Kourindou is very liberal-minded."
<br><br>
The reporter was clearly treating me as an enemy. More than likely, it was because she was assertively taking part in the 'power struggle' mentioned earlier by Reimu. Though I was at a loss as to how I was going to explain it to Reimu, she was surprisingly calm.
<br><br>
"By the foreigner, you mean Sumireko, right? She's not as dangerous a person as you think she is, Aya."
<br><br>
It appears that she had already figured out that Sumireko had been visiting my place. I pat my chest in relief.
<br><br>
"Hm, I wonder if that's really so. Isn't it your job to send back humans that have wandered in from outside? But then why are you leaving her as she is?"
<br><br>
"That only applies to humans that have wandered in by accident. In her case, she's coming in of her own free will... And the real cause is actually unknown, so it's a little more complicated."
<br><br>
"Oh my, that's a pitiful thing to hear. Let me make a note of that."
<br><br>
Aya happily recorded something in her notebook.
<br><br>
"Make a note of that? Don't even think about making this into an article."
<br><br>
"What are you saying? As someone who works to expose the truth, I won't stop just because someone tells me to."
<br><br>
Though Reimu tried to snatch the notebook away, she was easily dodged, and a picture of her frantic expression ended up being taken instead.
<br><br>
"'The Hakurei Shrine in Cahoots with the Foreigner to Take Over Gensokyo!?' An article like that would definitely be a huge shock, wouldn't it?"
<br><br>
Aya grinned widely.
<br><br>
"Expose the truth, as if. They're just a bunch of made-up fake articles!"
<br><br>
"Oh, but I happen to believe that that is the truth. So what's wrong with simply trying to report that truth? No such things as truly objective facts exist except in ideal worlds like mathematics. This is the answer that I have chosen to maintain as a reporter. That's why, this new post-truth is something I will create!"
<br><br>
—Ah, ginger tea on a winter day is really the best. The warmth spreads throughout my body...
<br><br>
As usual, a quarrel between the reporter and the shrine maiden had begun, so I watched over them from a distance while recovering some warmth. Though the reporter had been saying some ominous things, it was probably all just provocation. It was possible that the matter of Miss Usami weighed that much on her mind.
<br><br>
"By the way, you two. This isn't some place to lounge around, so do you perhaps have anything else to take care of?"
<br><br>
"Yes, of course. According to one of my information channels, I heard that 'the foreigner would appear here today', so I thought I would do some impromptu journalism."
<br><br>
"Eh? Miss Usami is?"
<br><br>
That was the first time I was hearing of it. And Reimu continued from there.
<br><br>
"You heard that from the hermit, right? I'm also here because I also heard that information. Here to really drill it into her head that whenever she comes to Gensokyo, she should be coming to the shrine."
<br><br>
"I came to collect some data, but when I found Reimu already here, doesn't that make things even more suspicious? It wouldn't be unusual to think that the two of you are connected behind the scenes."
<br><br>
Saying that, Aya took several more pictures of Reimu.
<br><br>
Getting a little irritated at the reporter's behavior, I gave her a warning with provocation in mind.
<br><br>
"You'd be better off not constructing truth based off a single point of information. It can easily turn into waste."
<br><br>
"Thank you very much for the warning, but I know that much even without needing to be told. That's why I'm here, after all. In order to connect all the points together, I wanted to ask the person herself..."
<br><br>
"Before you conduct your interview, I'd like to have a little talk with Sumireko first."
<br><br>
"See, that's very suspicious. You're trying to make sure your stories line up, aren't you?"
<br><br>
"It's not that. See, that person, well, lacks a bit of common sense."
<br><br>
"That's a lame excuse."
<br><br>
It seemed like another quarrel was brewing, so I tried to force my way in between them.
<br><br>
"Well, well, it seems the two of you have oddly come here with the same goal in mind. I'd like it if you two wouldn't fight."
<br><br>
The two of them faced away from each other.
<br><br>
"So, when's Miss Usami coming, anyway?"
<br><br>
"Let's see... She should've been here a while ago. She has a pattern of coming to Gensokyo at certain times, you see..."
<br><br>
"According to the information I procured, the time she was expected to arrive has long since passed indeed."
<br><br>
"Hm? What? Don't tell me—"
<br><br>
I had a very bad premonition. A deep snow had fallen outside, and visibility was poor. With no one to shovel the snow, there wouldn't be a path to the store.
<br><br>
"She didn't get into an accident, did she?"
<br><br>
—No sooner had I said that than the two took action.
<br><br>
Watching those two rush outside with no hesitation made them seem almost reliable. It was a big difference from me, not wanting to leave the warm store because my ginger tea was still warm and I had started to look for a padded kimono.
<br><br>
Well, even if Miss Usami had gotten into an accident, it would be fine if those two were seriously looking for her. The ones that would be the most troubled by an outside human going missing would be the shrine maiden and the youkai. There was no doubt that they would search for her with their lives on the line. With the intention of leaving it to them, I figured I may as well ready a warm drink.
<br><br>
—Ring ring.
<br><br>
Before long, the two of them returned with a girl, shivering from the cold, on their shoulders. See, it's times like this that the shrine maiden and the tengu can be exceedingly reliable. There was really no need for me to expressly go out into the cold as well.
<br><br>
"Oh, that was fast. You must be cold, right?"
<br><br>
I offered her the ginger tea.
<br><br>
"Wow, I thought I would die. Everything around me was completely white, and it was like, where in the countryside am I?"
<br><br>
Sumireko was in a bit of an excited state.
<br><br>
"To come dressed so lightly and in shoes so short, does snow not fall in the outside world?"
<br><br>
"There's only about a few centimeters of snow at any time. Although I guess it would fall like this deep into the mountains."
<br><br>
"You've really had a hard time, then. Although you seem more like you've had the time of your life."
<br><br>
"I-it's nothing like that. It's not like I would run around and play just because I saw this much snow. I just got a bit lost when trying to take a picture, since it was rare for me."
<br><br>
It was clear that she had run around. I had thought that the only ones who would run around after just seeing snow were very young children... Perhaps the people of the outside world were much more innocent at heart than I had thought.~
<br><br>
"Well, regardless, I'm glad you're safe. You should really give proper thanks. The ones who saved you are those two over there, after all."
<br><br>
"Really, thank you very much!"
<br><br>
Reimu was shocked at Sumireko's lighthearted attitude.
<br><br>
"It's fine this time since I was here, but if you take accidents like this too lightly, you'll die, you know!"
<br><br>
"Sorry about that. But I figured that since I'd go back if I just woke up from my dream, an hour or so would be fine."
<br><br>
"If you just woke up...? Now I wonder what that could mean."
<br><br>
Aya jumped at the opportunity. Seeing an unfamiliar face, Sumireko was rather bewildered.
<br><br>
"Ah, pardon me. I am the first-class newspaper reporter, Aya Shameimaru."
<br><br>
As if she were an office worker, Aya handed over a business card.
<br><br>
"Newspaper... reporter? There are jobs like that even here in Gensokyo?"
<br><br>
"Yes, just like the reporters of the outside world, Gensokyo is also in need of people to disseminate the truth."
<br><br>
"Yes, just like the reporters of the outside world, Gensokyo is also in need of people to disseminate the truth."
<br><br>
"You are Sumireko Usami, correct? Excuse me for asking while you're still tired from that accident, but would it be all right to ask for your cooperation with an interview later?"
<br><br>
Though Reimu whispered "It's okay to refuse," Sumireko gave an immediate response with a "Sounds good!"
<br><br>
"An interview? It's almost like I'm a celebrity! What kind of article is it?"
<br><br>
"Up until now, I've been printing nothing but newspapers, so this time, I thought I'd try my hand at a magazine, so..."
<br><br>
"Eh? It's the first time I'm hearing that you were making a magazine," said Reimu.
<br><br>
"Did I not tell you? To delve further into the truth, a different reporting style is necessary compared to the newspaper, whose main goal is to deliver information quickly. So I planned on publishing a book, using the outside world's magazines as reference, to achieve that!"
<br><br>
Aya pointed at the tabloid from the outside world.
<br><br>
"The name of my new tabloid will even be called 'Bunbunharu Weekly'. I've been gathering articles one after another, and I think you'll be shocked at the contents!"
<br><br>
Sumireko picked up the tabloid.
<br><br>
"Wow, it's a mass-market tabloid! Although the only ones I can imagine reading something like this are old guys."
<br><br>
"O-old guys?"
<br><br>
"To be honest, today's Internet Age doesn't really care all that much about some celebrity's affairs or drugs or money in politics. There are a lot of people that don't even watch TV. I don't know why people get so riled up about this stuff—it's a real mystery. Was I gonna be mentioned in a book like this? It's not like I'm part of any big scandal. Ah, don't tell me you were planning on interviewing me as a 'dokumo'!? Oh, you embarrass me!"
<br><br>
Sumireko rattled on at a rapid-fire rate.
<br><br>
"Uh, w-well. Something like that. Dokumo, right?"
<br><br>
"No way, don't mess with me like that! There's no way I could be a dokumo. You want to interview me about the outside world, don't you?"
<br><br>
"Er, well, that's..."
<br><br>
Her mouth was succeeding in putting pressure on the high-handed tengu. Both Reimu and I were covering our mouths and trying not to laugh. Dokumo was an approximation of a dokugumo (poisonous spider) that would fixedly wait until they caught their prey. Watching as if the prey were being lured into the trap and caught, it really seemed as if Miss Usami was a dokumo.
<br><br>
"U-um. Then, once again, I would like to change locations and conduct an interview."
<br><br>
Aya kept glancing in the direction of Reimu and me. It seemed she didn't want us to hear the contents of her information gathering.
<br><br>
"Well, I have to go back to the outside world soon. So, if it's all right to do it some other day."
<br><br>
"Yes, that would be more convenient for me as well. As for the location... We can meet at a conference room on the mountain."
<br><br>
"Wait, I won't accept that," said Reimu, forcing her way into the conversation.
<br><br>
"It's fine if I don't hear what you guys are talking about, but at least do it in a place where I can see you!"
<br><br>
Reimu's expression had suddenly become stern. The atmosphere even overwhelmed Sumireko.
<br><br>
"All right? I don't think I've said this yet, but this sorry excuse for a reporter is not human, you see."
<br><br>
"Eh? Not human?"
<br><br>
"She's a youkai. Even more, she's a tengu, known for kidnapping humans. So don't go following her so eagerly to her hideout."
<br><br>
Reimu spoke to Sumireko as if trying to terrify her. But it seemed this backfired.
<br><br>
"A tengu? Amazing, that's amazing! It's like I've met someone really important! Gensokyo, banzai!"
<br><br>
"A-anyway, I'll let you use the shrine, so you can do your interview there!"
<br><br>
Reimu tried to emphasize that point.
<br><br>
"All right. I'm fine with doing it anywhere!"
<br><br>
"Yes, yes. Understood. I'm sure there's some truth you want to hide from me. But this will affect the truth in the end, anyway, so I don't mind whatever ends up happening."
<br><br>
After scheduling their next meeting, Aya and Sumireko were sent off.
<br><br>
Reimu suddenly looked like she was completely exhausted.
<br><br>
As she left, she said, "Ah, right, right. Answering that earlier question. Tengu are definitely out of the question. Saying stuff like making up the truth, someone like her definitely can't be the leader of Gensokyo!"
<br><br>
Nevertheless, that Miss Usami was really a piece of work. To make even an experienced tengu falter on a peculiar train of thought, and to make even Reimu lend out her shrine—it was not something an ordinary person could do. And in Reimu's case, she had left without even fulfilling her original goal to warn Sumireko to not do anything on her own.
<br><br>
I looked forward to what sort of article her interview would result in.
<br><br>
—That was what I had thought at the time. However, Aya Shameimaru's first magazine, 'Bunbunharu Weekly', would not be released to the world. It appeared she had made some grievous oversight and prohibited its publication of her own will. Though I was glad that a new truth had not been invented, I was a little disappointed, as I had been looking forward to the articles.
