                    Although a lot of people don't like going to school, that definitely can't be said for everyone.
                    Some people find long breaks excruciating since they have to dig up the initiative to plan their own
                    schedules. No matter what any loner says, the fact is that no man is an island and total isolation
                    is equal to death. Those who don't mind being alone will try to wave it off as saying that prefer
                    being that way, and reject the pity of others. However, I'm an exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When summer vacation started, since I didn't have any friends to hang out with, I just holed myself
                    up in my room the whole time. It wasn't that I was a "hikkikomori," afraid to go out into the world.
                    I was more like an artist protecting their aesthetic standards from being muddled by the common
                    style, a mathematician trying to solve the Millennium Problems, or a monk trying to reach
                    enlightenment. Basically, it was a constructive isolation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually gained the ability to travel to a world of fantasy while I sleep. I didn't really
                    understand why, but it clearly had something to do with me forcing my way in before. So while my
                    body was stuck in my room, my mind was off exploring and discovering new things every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It feels so much cooler in Gensokyo. Maybe because it's at a higher altitude? I can't confirm that
                    without a GPS, though..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking advantage of the summer vacation, I had been spending longer periods of time in Gensokyo.
                    Strangely enough, even though I was always sleeping, my body didn't seem weaker. If anything, I
                    gained a bit of muscle tone. Whether I was moving in my sleep, or my real body had come with me too,
                    I couldn't tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now, where should I go today? Reimu and Marisa told me not to go near the mountain or the forest,
                    but they didn't say why..."
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obeying my curiosity, I headed towards the forest. I was only dreaming, after all, and I had become
                    used to youkai and phantoms, so I didn't expect to be particularly surprised by anything. That was
                    what I thought when I found someone carrying a large object wrapped in a cloth. She didn't seem to
                    notice me, and the cloth wasn't able to cover the entirety of her load. It looked like an electrical
                    appliance of some kind, which I hadn't seen much of in Gensokyo. Intrigued, I followed after her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while, I noticed we were approaching the forest. My heart began to race as I expected her to
                    pass beneath the canopy, but then I saw she had turned towards a modest-sized building and a
                    warehouse not far away. All sorts of objects were scattered around it, and I thought it was one of
                    those troublesome garbage dumps at first. However, upon closer look, they were arranged with a clear
                    purpose. The items themselves were surprising, too: road signs, bicycles, cassette players, CRT TVs,
                    and other stuff from the 1980s and earlier (long before my time) I had only seen in pictures. And
                    since they were all things I recognized as being from my world, I thought I had left Gensokyo at
                    some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I approached the building with a sign above its door that said "Kourindou." It seemed that was the
                    name of the store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I surveyed the interior of my shop. Practically everything seemed to not have functioned for quite
                    some time. I was just about tired of looking at them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In spite of that, the arrival of new goods increased as of late, particularly machines that require
                    electricity. Unfortunately, supply far outweighed demand, and so they sat unsold. I thought I
                    wouldn't be able to continue business if conditions persisted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Rinnosuke Morichika. I'm the owner of the curio shop "Kourindou."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than sell items one can find anywhere, I thought to deal in a new trade -- the sale of items
                    from the outside world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why I don't feel too lonely on days without any visitors. That isolation gives me time to
                    figure out how to use my collection. Even if I never have any customers...
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Ring-a-ling*
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, is this a store or something?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Welcome, and yes, this is a curio shop. If you see anything you like, don't hesitate to ask."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Wow, a curio shop.... I see, that'd explain things."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But don't mistake this for a regular antique shop. I deal mainly with objects from the outside
                    world, the only one of its kind in Gensokyo."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Aha, hmmm..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You don't seem surprised... I bet you haven't seen anything like this before, have you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, that takes me back! I haven't seen a cell phone that doesn't fold in forever! So you even have
                    this sort of stuff here..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You knew that was a cell phone? Who are you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I live in the outside world. My name's Sumireko Usami. Nice to meet you."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Y-you're from the outside world? You must be joking..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No, I'm serious. Hmm, how could I prove it...? Ah, I know. Here, it's the latest model cell phone.
                    "
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hadn't been so surprised in years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the ability to know the name and utility of an object merely by looking at it. The girl
                    showed me an item called a "smartphone" that was clearly from the outside world. And the fact it was
                    operable proved that she, too, was clearly from the outside world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even considering the nature of my business, I never thought I would meet someone from the outside
                    world. However, becoming overwhelmed with excitement would have been imprudent, and so I strove to
                    feign composure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "H-how did you come to Gensokyo?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, it was a bit of a mistake, but I managed to force my way in a while ago. And ever since then,
                    I'm able to come here whenever I dream for some reason."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Really? So does that mean you're dreaming right this moment?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's right. I come to Gensokyo when I sleep, and I return to the real world when I wake up. I've
                    been coming and going all summer."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hmm, how strange. By the way, have you met Reim-I mean the Hakurei shrine maiden yet?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yes, I know Reimu. I usually spend time at the shrine whenever I come here."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, that saved some trouble. I thought to warn Reimu that something was wrong with the barrier,
                    but it seemed there wasn't anything to worry about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that case, it left me with one more pressing matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So, if you are from the outside world, are you able to bring in other items of interest with you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Huh?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As you can plainly see, I sell products from your world. I'm certain from your point of view, these
                    are all standard, commonplace goods, are they not?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I wouldn't say that; they're a little too outdated... In fact, almost everything is from before I
                    was born."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having long believed to own the latest merchandise, this came as a slight shock to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I see... Well, in any case, I'm interested in items from your world, so I want to see if you can
                    bring something else from there."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She couldn't bring anything large with her. It was only natural, as she would have be able to fall
                    asleep while holding it on her person. Nothing larger than a small handbag or smartphone would be
                    feasible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But the smartphone can't do much if it's out of range. It's still useful though, since it tells the
                    time and I can read books on it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Read books, you say?"</p>
                <p>
                    "Yep, with an e-book reader. I have a decent-sized library in here, even if it's all comics."</p>
                <p>
                    "Impressive. I could probably sell something like that in this world as well, since there is no
                    shortage of book-lovers."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I don't like the sound of that."</p>
                <p>
                    "Why not?"</p>
                <p>
                    "If everyone in Gensokyo had a smartphone, that'd kind of kill the mystique for me, for some
                    reason."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm not sure I understand..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In the outside world right now, everyone's glued to their smartphones, no matter if they're waiting
                    for a train or sitting at a restaurant."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If the people in the outside world are that fascinated with them, then why not give them to the
                    people of Gensokyo?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'll admit they're vital for communication, but then people use them for pointless chatting,
                    reading gossip on the internet, playing games, watching videos... I'm like, turn that stupid thing
                    off and pay attention to what's in front of you, you know? The world is full of amazing things, but
                    no one seems to notice. They'd rather take "hilarious" pictures to post online even when the occult
                    is just under their noses."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not entirely certain, but she suddenly launched into a miniature rant full of incomprehensible
                    indignation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If everyone in Gensokyo ended up as smartphone addicts, I might as well stop visiting. Assuming I'd
                    be able to, anyway."</p>
                <p>
                    "I see, so everyone in the outside world is overly dependent on smartphones. However, what I find
                    odd is how you seem to value yours though you seem to dislike them so much."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "W-well, I did say they were useful. It tells time, acts as a library, and lets me check the train
                    schedule."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So if it's that useful, then I'm certain others will feel the same."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But you see, no one will ever look up from it, even when they're in the same place with their
                    friends. Our society has valued long-distance communication too much, causing interpersonal
                    communication skills to decline. It's a big social problem."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I don't see how I could see a problem from a world I know nothing about. I just think that tools
                    are there for the improvement of mankind. It's impossible they cause society to regress without it
                    being some sort of magic item."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I knew the utility of everything I saw, I had never seen an item made for the sole detriment
                    of humanity. In the case of the smartphone, though it had a host of applications, at the core its
                    purpose was to "provide free supply of personal information." That was how simply holding it could
                    help protect civic order. It was unthinkable that the inventor of such a highly social device wished
                    to debilitate the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now then, how much would you sell that smartphone for?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I can't sell this! It's the latest model, and besides, it hasn't even been paid off yet."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hmm..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Wait a second, does that mean you buy stuff from the outside world, too?"</p>
                <p>
                    "That I do. I normally sell whatever I find on my own, but I will purchase items on occasion. And
                    I'd give up an arm and a leg for usable merchandise."</p>
                <p>
                    "Okay, in that case, I'll bring some things I have lying around next time. I've always wanted money
                    from Gensokyo."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What, does that mean you're poor?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No, I've just never needed money here. It's incredible how everyone here gets along without it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Gensokyo operates mostly on bartering, although the humans and youkai have their own systems as
                    well."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Bartering, huh?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The girl wore a thoughtful face as if remembering something.</p>
                <p>
                    "What is it?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "By the way, I got here by following someone carrying an electrical appliance in a large cloth. I
                    wonder if she came here to barter with that."</p>
                <p>
                    "That wasn't a customer; that was my helper."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the places I could hunt for wares had been restricted as of late, I hired an assistant to search
                    in my stead. She came with all sorts of strange items, one after the other. As payment, I would give
                    her a small fee as well as tell her about the items she retrieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, she seemed to have an inclination to pick up electrical items, which meant my store was
                    filled with the worthless things. I began to think I needed to handle searching myself once again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her latest delivery was regarded by the human from the outside world as unfamiliar. It too seemed to
                    be behind her time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whoa, it's a mini-disc player. I've heard about them, but it's the first one I've seen. And this is
                    a cassette tape recorder? This place is nothing but antiques... They might go for a good price if
                    you put them on auction sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Those items are valuable, so don't get rough with them."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "All right. By the way, how much are they?"</p>
                <p>
                    "I thought you didn't have any money? Well, no harm in telling you. They go for about this much."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Um, I'm not sure if that's expensive or not."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's about several times the worth of your smartphone. Going by size, anyway."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That much?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Promising to bring something during her next visit, she left the store. Though I did not make a
                    sale, this chance meeting held far greater value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was beginning to consider closing my shop, fed up with the monotony in deliveries as of late. But
                    that unexpected occurrence would undoubtedly lead to a deeper comprehension of my merchandise which
                    would in turn create a better understanding of their value. Kourindou itself may even be reborn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I did not mind isolation, I reconsidered after meeting the girl. Meeting other people helps
                    expand one's knowledge and encourage development. The same could be said for tools, which could even
                    result in them finding new life. I wanted to take my collection and start sharing it with others,
                    because I then felt that was probably the mission of a curio store.
