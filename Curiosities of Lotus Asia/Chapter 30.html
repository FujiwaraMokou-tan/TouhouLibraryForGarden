<br>
I get the feeling that everyone in Gensokyo has been acting distant lately. I think this is because of the three weeks when I couldn't visit Gensokyo, but it brings to mind an uncomfortable feeling, like getting stuck in a parallel world where everything is slightly off. Today I'm visiting the Hakurei Shrine again, but Reimu's face looks a little gloomy.
<br><br>
"So anyway, there's this fireworks festival happening near where I live, but it isn't exactly easy to go to a fireworks festival by yourself, you know. So I'd love it if you could come with me, Reimucchi."
<br><br>
"An outside world fireworks festival, huh? I wouldn't mind going, but..."
<br><br>
"Can't you just come to the real world like you did that other time?"
<br><br>
The place I met my very first friend in Gensokyo was in the real world. At the time, Reimu had come out to the real world. She's always evasive about it, but there's definitely SOME way for them to leave Gensokyo.
<br><br>
"A-Anyway, have you noticed anything strange on your end, Sumireko?"
<br><br>
"Huh? Not really."
<br><br>
"Oh. Well, that's good... But if you ever noticed anything, let me know, okay?"
<br><br>
This. This is what I'm talking about. I feel like I've had a lot of these... talks, not substantial enough to be called a conversation, that sound like they're searching for something.
<br><br>
It's just, well, this sort of thing happens from time to time in the real world. A fashionable new drama, a popular musician, a dessert that appeared in some photos, a famous video content creator, light otaku content... Humans in the real world seem to be animals who can't survive without being able to bond over some topic or another. Especially in an insular society like a school, where in just a short amount of time, you could end up developing an interest in something outside the normal, shared hobbies, enter a world only you find fun, and find yourself facing social extinction. It happens all the time. And I guess it happens in Gensokyo too.
<br><br>
"Oh, but, if you're asking about strange things happening, I guess I did find my smartphone full of all these pictures I don't remember taking."
<br><br>
"Do you mean pictures of danmaku?"
<br><br>
I show her my phone. Reimu doesn't seem very surprised.
<br><br>
"Yeah, that's right. But it's not just danmaku, there are also youkai I've never met. I wonder who took these."
<br><br>
"That... sure is mysterious, huh?"
<br><br>
With just that one careless joke, the curt Reimu's attitude seemed unnatural.
<br><br>
The small secondhand goods shop, Kourindou. The only customer was the outsider, Sumireko Usami.
<br><br>
The owner, Rinnosuke, was conflicted.
<br><br>
"So anyway, Reimu's been all acting all distant. Like she's hiding something. The only one who's acting the same as always is you, Rinnosuke."
<br><br>
"Is that so?"
<br><br>
"C'mon, can't you just tell me already? What happened during the three weeks I was gone? Does everyone know why I couldn't come then?"
<br><br>
For three weeks, she had gone missing from Gensokyo and a search was conducted. As a result, we learned that the Sumireko Usami in front of me is neither the original, nor her dream self. She's something called a Doppelganger. In other words, she's a youkai-like being. At the very least, she's not human. The real Sumireko Usami should be asleep in the real world, even now.
<br><br>
But she herself believes that she's human. It would be easy enough to tell her her circumstances and what had happened, but would that really be right? Plus, it seems that even Reimu and the others aren't sure how to treat her. And if she is a youkai, should she be the target of extermination? No conclusion was forthcoming.
<br><br>
However, she seems to share sensations and memories with the real one, and each of her consciousnesses don't seem to be independent. For that reason, and because we don't know what effect if will have if we reveal her true identity, we've been doing our best not to rock the boat.
<br><br>
Personally, as long as she isn't hostile, I see no reason to treat her like an enemy. And since she herself already has doubts related to her Dream Syndrome, I'd love to fill in the three week gap in her memory for her, but...
<br><br>
"During the three weeks you were gone, we were all pretty worried about you, and even formed a search party. Well, I say "search" but since we can't go to the outside world, it was limited to Gensokyo."
<br><br>
"Oh? So that's what happened. I made everyone worry about me, huh..."
<br><br>
"We'd be in big trouble if you were caught by a youkai, after all. Even the outside world would be in an uproar. So it was a big relief when you came back."
<br><br>
"It kinda sounds like you're trying to pull a fast one on me, but still, thank you very much. But in the end, what DID happen those three weeks?"
<br><br>
"I don't know the details. Maybe you just in poor health or couldn't properly dream or something?"
<br><br>
"So it's a matter of my health, huh? You're right though, I kinda feel like I was having nightmares... Can't remember 'em though."Â´
<br><br>
Sumireko was starting to get annoyed at this inconclusive conversation.
<br><br>
"Well, whatever! There's no use thinking about all that! So everyone's acting all distant as a backlash from worrying about me then? Then I just need to start being thankful for that. I'll think of it as a plus."
<br><br>
Sumireko returned to her usual cheerful self. It seems she's always been good at self-healing. Perhaps the youth of the outside world all have high self-control.
<br><br>
Ding a ling
<br><br>
"Welcome... oh it's Marisa."
<br><br>
"That's right, I'm your god. In other words, a customer."
<br><br>
I'd heard the phrase "the customer is your god" before, but never of a customer declaring herself god. Of course, Marisa Kirisame isn't a customer either.
<br><br>
"Ooh, you're here too, Sumireko? Good, good."
<br><br>
"Good? What do you mean?"
<br><br>
"Y'know, you went missing that one time, so everyone's all sensitive to it. Like you might disappear the second we take our eyes off you. Just seein' you at all is a little relaxin'."
<br><br>
"Sorry about that. Sounds like I made you worry."
<br><br>
Sumireko had an apologetic, slightly embarrassed expression.
<br><br>
"Whoa there, maybe that came out wrong? WE'RE the ones who got worried all on our own. You don't need to worry about it."
<br><br>
Thanks to Marisa's unhelpful follow-up, the mood became a little awkward.
<br><br>
"By the way Marisa, what are you here for today?"
<br><br>
"Nothing cool's been happenin' lately, so Reimu's down in the dumps. So I figured we should hold some kind event before she turns to villainy. And she's real close, let me tell you. So I was lookin' for anythin' that might lead to somethin'."
<br><br>
"What the heck? If she's bored, why not just hold a festival?"
<br><br>
"Cuz she's always holdin' festivals. She's stuck in a rut. That's why we need some kinda centerpiece. Like, even puttin' some mysterious tool you've got here on display should be enough."
<br><br>
I looked over my store. I'm proud to be the number one stop for mysterious articles in Gensokyo. Naturally, I have more than a few that could entertain someone.
<br><br>
"I see. Then how about this one?"
<br><br>
"Looks like a big ol' helmet."
<br><br>
"Those are... Those are VR..."
<br><br>
Sumireko was surprised to see the helmet.
<br><br>
"Ah yes, those are 'VR Goggles'. I can't believe I'm seeing them in an old antique shop. It's such a mismatch."
<br><br>
I put them on my head. My vision was completely blocked, covering the world in darkness. A little while later, a rainbow of flowers blooming in a beautiful meadow stretched out before me. Or so I felt.
<br><br>
"These make it so that 'You can experience unrealistic scenery as if it were real.' I'm currently seeing a beautiful meadow."
<br><br>
"Whoa! That sounds awesome!"
<br><br>
Marisa took the VR Goggles from me as if stealing them away. Then she put them on.
<br><br>
"Let's see here... It's just pitch black?"
<br><br>
"That's normal. It's a device that cuts you off from all light to make it easier experience the images you want to. I think."
<br><br>
"Hmm... Still not seeing anythin'."
<br><br>
"It relies on the power of your imagination."
<br><br>
"Oooh! I'm startin' to see somethin'! I'm flying over an endless stretch of water! Is this the ocean?! It's the ocean!"
<br><br>
Marisa was excited. Sumireko glanced over with an icy gaze.
<br><br>
"C'mon, it's not even plugged in. There's no power. Of course it's pitch black."
<br><br>
"Huh? But I really am seein' this stuff? I feel like I am anyway."
<br><br>
Now that she mentions it, I get the feeling that if you wanted pitch blackness, you could just close your eyes.
<br><br>
"Man, flying over the ocean was awesome!" Marisa took off the goggles, satisfied.
<br><br>
"If you had that much fun with unplugged VR goggles, maybe the people in Gensokyo have way too much imagination. In that case, I think it's a bit early to introduce VR at a festival."
<br><br>
Sumireko remembered a VR she had seen that let you experience being inside a firework.
<br><br>
"Oh, I know, how about an ordinary fireworks festival?"
<br><br>
"Fireworks festival? I get the fireworks, but how does the festival come in? What's that like?"
<br><br>
"Let's see... They launch these giant fireworks, andâ Oh right, there's a big fireworks festival near where I live. Want to come with me?"
<br><br>
"Sounds nice, I'd love to, but... It's in the outside world, right? No can do."
<br><br>
"Huh? But haven't you been outside before?"
<br><br>
"That was, like, an accident. We can't usually come and go freely."
<br><br>
"That's too bad. Oh well. I'll take pictures, and you can look at those."
<br><br>
A few days later, at the Hakurei Shrine. Reimu, Marisa, and Sumireko are there.
<br><br>
As promised, she's showing them the pictures she took of the fireworks festival.
<br><br>
"Wow, that's pretty. So these are outside world fireworks, huh?"
<br><br>
Sumireko was showing the pictures on her smartphone.
<br><br>
"Amazing, isn't it? I mean, it's just the small, local fireworks festival near my house, but still, their biggest shakudan was just crazy!"
<br><br>
"Oh? So just how big is it then?"
<br><br>
"These were taken from pretty far away... I wonder, how big IS it? One sec."~
<br><br>
With the bad habit of looking things up before thinking, she punched the words "fireworks size" into the screen.
<br><br>
"Oh, right, no signal. Well, I'm sure they're amazingly huge. Yeah."
<br><br>
Reimu and Marisa eagerly snapped up the images of fireworks the likes of which they'd never seen, but seemed unable to grasp how they'd even begin to actually prepare fireworks like that. At that moment, a mysterious impulse rose up in Sumireko, and behavior even she couldn't understand showed itself. On the smartphone, Reimu swiped from a picture of fireworks to a picture of something else.
<br><br>
"Oh? But this one looks pretty easy to dodge."
<br><br>
Said Reimu.
<br><br>
"C'mon, firework ain't danmaku you know... wait, that's danmaku!"
<br><br>
"Yeah, those are the photos of spellcards I took in Gensokyo..."
<br><br>
Thinking they were pictures of the fireworks festival, they looked pictures of spellcards. As a result, Reimu saw spellcards as fireworks, and came up with the idea of a danmaku fireworks festival.
<br><br>
Days later, it was the day before the danmaku contest labeled an evening fireworks festival was to be held. Sumireko was at Kourindou.
<br><br>
"It's finally tomorrow, huh? The fireworks festival born from your idea."
<br><br>
"It wasn't MY idea, it was Reimucchi'."
<br><br>
"The humans think that, but I hear a lot of the youkai think it was your idea. The outsider. Do you know why?"
<br><br>
"Umm... Why?"
<br><br>
"Because of the pictures used on the fliers. They're obviously the ones taken by your phone."
<br><br>
"Oh, of course. Wait, but I didn't take those pictures... maybe the subjects of the photos know who took them."
<br><br>
"Those subjects say that you're the one who took them though."
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
"Do you know what I'm trying to say?"
<br><br>
"The pictures on my smartphone... basically you're saying I took them? I can't remember it at all, but... maybe I have split personalities or something...? That's like something out of a psychological horror story..."
<br><br>
Sumireko looked troubled.
<br><br>
The firework festival had already caused some worry. More than a few youkai seemed displeased, and there was even a rumor that some radical youkai were plotting something. Reimu had been told, but her response of "don't worry, that's why we have powerful people gathered as judges" had failed to ease their worries.
<br><br>
But I had a guess as to who this person they say is plotting something is.
<br><br>
"You're serving as a judge. It might be in a little dangerous for you at the festival."
<br><br>
Seeing her resolve, I told her the truth.
<br><br>
"I don't know if you're just pretending not to know, but you're not the real Sumireko."
<br><br>
"What...?"
<br><br>
"You're a youkai, a doppelganger. The real Sumireko is in the outside world."
<br><br>
"...?!"
<br><br>
"The photos on your smartphone were taken during a time only the doppelganger wouldn't remember. Reimu and the others know this."
<br><br>
"But... I have memories of the outside world. I remember my childhood. This is ridiculous."
<br><br>
"Well, I said you were a doppelganger, but you share her memories, and I doubt even the real one could tell the difference. But haven't you ever felt it was weird? The phenomenon where you only come to Gensokyo in your dreams? And not just spiritually like a living spirit or an astral projection, but with a real flesh and blood body. It makes no sense. We only realized this recently, but the Sumireko in Gensokyo, ie: YOU, was a doppelganger the whole time."
<br><br>
"..."
<br><br>
Sumireko was speechless. Well, obviously. She'd just been convinced that she's an imposter, of course she'd shaken.
<br><br>
"Well, it's not that important, really. Apparently doppelgangers share both spirits and flesh with the real thing. And when you wake up, you'll have the doppelganger's memories too. So you can think of it as having a second real one...Try not to feel too down, Sumireko."
<br><br>
"You're saying I'm...the me right here is a youkai?"
<br><br>
"Yeah. Perhaps 'youkai' is going a little too far though. Maybe 'occult'?"
<br><br>
"Alright! I'm so happy!"
<br><br>
"Huh?"
<br><br>
Sumireko was unexpectedly cheerful. It was almost disappointing.
<br><br>
"I've always thought I was special, not a normal human. That I was definitely some kind of unique being. A human schoolgirl while awake, but a youkai while asleep! This is the best thing that's ever happened to me! Now I'm officially part of Gensokyo!"
<br><br>
The next day. The day of the fireworks festival.
<br><br>
Sumireko had been enthusiastically collecting her observations on the danmaku into a book.
<br><br>
Personally, I had been wondering what the purpose of this fireworks festival was. While Reimu wanted it to attract visitors, actually there was someone else who was profiting from it even more. That would be Sumireko. Didn't Sumireko's doppelganger half have its own consciousness too, and hadn't she enticed Reimu into holding this danmaku fireworks festival to give her an opportunity to come into contact with even more youkai?
<br><br>
Sumireko had been able to take pictures without being aware of it. So the doppelganger must have some kind of consciousness too. I thought we needed to continue to observe her.
