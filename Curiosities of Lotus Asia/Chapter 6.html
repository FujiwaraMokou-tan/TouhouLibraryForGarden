				<p>
					The deep red poison of the Higan flowers blocked the way. These grounds were protected by these
					strange-looking Higan flowers, beautiful and fleeting, as if they were not of this world. I thought
					that
					certainly, in this place, the inside and outside of the Border, and even yet another world, are
					mingled
					like an "impossible intersection of borders." Items that I've never seen might fall in a mysterious
					place like this.</p>
				<p>
					"This is certainly a mountain of treasure."</p>
				<p>
					When the autumnal equinox comes, I always go out for grave visiting. But even so, the place I go to
					is
					not a normal cemetery; it is a place where the humans with no relatives in Gensokyo - the nameless
					dead
					- go to rest. Yes, I go to the Mound of the Nameless in Muenzuka.</p>
				<p>
					And as for why there is such a place as Muenzuka in Gensokyo, where the number of humans is small:
					it is
					an effect of the present balance between youkai and humans. There are no longer any humans who
					exterminate youkai completely, and there are hardly any youkai who attack humans anymore, either. It
					would be a problem if the number of either youkai or humans were to increase, and it would be a
					problem
					as well if it decreases.</p>
				<p>
					If a corpse is neglected, it will usually end up being eaten by some youkai. And having
					corpse-eating
					youkai going around is not sanitary. Disease would spread, which is not good for humans. Plus,
					humans
					could become youkai after death. If the number of humans decreases, and the number of youkai
					increases,
					the current state of equilibrium would be ruined. Because of that, as of late, not even the remains
					of
					the nameless go neglected in Gensokyo. The remains of those are cremated, and put to rest here.
					Thanks
					to that, you can say that the dead humans of Gensokyo really leave their bodies behind to become
					ghosts.
					Even those dead without relatives are cremated, and their ashes buried here.</p>
				<p>
					As for why I am in this place, obviously, it's for mourning those nameless dead. I most certainly am
					<i>not</i> here to pick up the "unworldly rare" outside items that came in with those nameless dead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, most of the nameless dead without relatives in Gensokyo are people from the outside. This wall
					between this place and the Netherworld is thin, and, as a consequence of that, this place is also
					close
					to the outside world. People, ghosts, and even mysterious items fall in here.</p>
				<p>
					"Thanks to the red poison of the Higanbana, this place is unharmed. It is just like a treasure
					mountain."</p>
				<p>
					Right from the start, I find nothing but interesting items, such as a bottomless ladle and a soul
					lantern that glows with the light of ghosts. Are those outside world goods, or maybe they are from
					the
					Netherworld? I'll say it as much as necessary, I didn't come here to pick up rare items, I came to
					pray
					for the nameless deceased. The outside items I am frantically picking up are just a reward for
					praying
					for those nameless dead; that's the only reason that I'm collecting them without hesitation.</p>
				<p>
					However, this merry feeling was crushed by an incomprehensible incident.</p>
				<p>
					When counting the number of bones after cremation, somehow the number of bones and the number of
					bodies
					before cremation didn't match; and it wasn't like there was merely one corpse too many. For some
					reason,
					only part of a body was in excess. Well, since there weren't any family members to retrieve the
					bones in
					the first place, the fact that there were too many wasn't exactly a problem, but still...</p>
				<p>
					"Were there that many nameless dead, Mr. Rinnosuke?"</p>
				<p>
					Without solving this inexplicable puzzle, I went back to my store, Kourindou. However, while its
					owner -
					myself - was away, the always selfish shrine maiden and the usually selfish magician had selfishly
					made
					themselves at home in my shop. That almost always happens.</p>
				<p>
					"Ahh, the nameless deceased were mostly all humans from outside. As you know, Reimu, there are very
					few
					unrelated people in Gensokyo. But as there are some people from outside that escape from being
					youkai
					food, yet lose their way here, there are always some dead in Muenzuka."</p>
				<p>
					"And what's that junk you're carryin'? Ya always got a lot of weird stuff."</p>
				<p>
					Marisa was the one who said that. If anything, she seemed interested in what I had collected.</p>
				<p>
					"These? These are what had fallen in Muenzuka, Marisa."</p>
				<p>
					"Graverobbin', huh?"</p>
				<p>
					"Graverobbing <i>indeed</i>. How awful."</p>
				<p>
					"Graverobbing? These were not offerings. Who in Gensokyo would leave offerings at Muenzuka anyway?
					Those
					items were most likely thrown away by some rude folk, and ended up drifting there."</p>
				<p>
					"So, what, it's just trash? Nobody'd buy that."</p>
				<p>
					"I'm not selling it; not right now, anyway."</p>
				<p>
					It's just a matter of time before trash becomes tools; it's the same as the cycle of death and
					rebirth.</p>
				<p>
					To end any further discussion, I changed the subject, trying to relate it to that mysterious extra
					bone
					from before I was now carrying.</p>
				<p>
					"By the way, Reimu, has there been any major incident in Gensokyo lately?"</p>
				<p>
					"Well, yes. There was this big incident - but it wasn't anything important."</p>
				<p>
					"As always, you don't seem to know if it was actually big or not. Well, whatever, it's just that
					something strange happened..."</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../Images/Chapter 10/10A.JPG" class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide" />
					I tried explaining to the two of them about the bone that was bothering me.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Huh...what? You wanna eat sushi or somethin'?" Marisa was saying nonsensical things, so I just let
					her
					be.</p>
				<p>
					"Is that true...? One bone too many..."</p>
				<p>
					"Indeed. Look, here it is."</p>
				<p>
					"Ack! How come you brought back something like <i>that?!</i>"</p>
				<p>
					"It's a right arm bone, isn't it? ...At the spring equinox, there was an extra right leg bone..."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Don't tell me you're trying to assemble the right half of a body piece by piece?" asked Reimu.</p>
				<p>
					"Not at all, but if that was the case, shouldn't I go for an entire body? Why would I stop at half
					of
					one?"</p>
				<p>
					"In any case, I don't have the least idea. Aren't those dead people mostly from the outside? If
					something weird is happening, wouldn't it be happening in the outside world?"</p>
				<p>
					"Funny to hear a shrine maiden callin' corpses 'those dead people'." Marisa was making fun of her.
				</p>
				<p>
					"That may be, but to think of a corpse entering Gensokyo piece by piece...I'd hope that no one in
					the
					outside world is up to no good."</p>
				<p>
					"But this bone...I'm pretty sure it's not human."</p>
				<p>
					Reimu started saying mysterious things again.</p>
				<p>
					"No matter how you look at it, isn't this a human bone? What kind of bone do you think it is?"</p>
				<p>
					"It's just that...there isn't any sign of its soul from when it was alive."</p>
				<p>
					"Huh? I never knew ya could see those kinda things, Reimu," said Marisa, appearing surprised.</p>
				<p>
					"Why, I <i>am</i> a shrine maiden, am I not?"</p>

				<p>
					The next day, I went to Muenzuka once again. For more prayer, of course.</p>
				<p>
					In the end, I couldn't solve the mystery of the extra bone yesterday. Conversely, the mystery only
					got
					deeper by the end of the conversation. I don't bother myself with things I don't understand, I
					forget
					them - a special ability that makes life easier....or so I wanted to.</p>
				<p>
					"Hmm...just as expected, but also surprising." Whoops. Seems that Reimu's way of talking is starting
					to
					rub off on me. What was just as expected is that today there's an extra bone here again. And what is
					so
					surprising is that the bone was identical to yesterday's - a right arm bone. I looked around to see
					if
					there was yet another right arm bone. "Today is the right arm equinox, I guess."</p>
				<p>
					Weird.</p>
				<p>
					If this bone is from a human from outside, then there must be a lot of people in the outside world
					losing only their right arms. But no, there's no way humans could do that. Even if one were to lose
					an
					arm in an accident, the connection between the body and the arm wouldn't be severed; even when
					separated, the arm would call for the former body, and the body would be under the impression that
					it
					has an arm. The human soul is lodged in the whole body, regardless of its physical condition.</p>
				<p>
					At this point, I started thinking about how the Border that surrounding Gensokyo affected things.
					About
					how it affected people's "thoughts." If a physical wall would be a wall that keeps the <i>body</i>
					from
					passing through, then the Border would be a wall that keeps people's <i>thoughts</i> from passing
					through. Going through the Border - in other words, to be "spirited away" - is something that
					happens
					when one is in a particular state of mind, where consciousness is hazy, and then your whole self
					would
					jump through. For only an arm to jump through the Border, it would mean the arm and the body have
					different thoughts. A human whose arm and body move with different wills? I don't think there is
					such a
					human, much less a lot of them. So maybe what Reimu said was right: this is not a human arm.</p>
				<p>
					...But anyway, it's a beautiful bone; you can't see any signs of the daily hardships in it. The size
					is
					as big as an adult's, but it looks as if it's a baby's. Could a human have grown up so perfectly?
					Would
					one raised in a family apart from any discomfort become like this?
				<p>
				<p>
					While I was thinking of this, I stared at the Higanbana blooming by my feet. The stems don't have
					any
					leaves. This strange flower doesn't have any leaves on its stem; it grows straight from the ground
					as a
					big red flower. Without any leaves, and carrying a lot of poison, this was an appropriate flower for
					the
					grounds where the nameless dead rest. The impression I had was that its beauty was one unrelated to
					anything else.</p>
				<p>
					...And then there was the body that severed its relation with this clean arm. I imagined a scenery
					of
					right arms growing in a row like the Higan flowers, and got an unsettling feeling from it.</p>
				<p>
					"...So, what's going on with the production-model right arms?"</p>
				<p>
					When I returned to my shop, the selfish-as-always Reimu and the selfish-as-always Marisa were
					waiting
					for me.</p>
				<p>
					"Ah, here's one."</p>
				<p>
					"Just because there's extra doesn't mean you have to bring them here," Reimu said, while holding her
					tea
					in one hand and biting into a rice cracker.</p>
				<p>
					"Hmm...there was something worrying me..."</p>
				<p>
					I went deeper inside the store and compared the bone I had found yesterday with the one I just
					picked
					up.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../Images/Chapter 10/10B.JPG" class="imageSizesOnTextLeftSide" />
					"What's worrying you? Ahh, I didn't get this rice cracker from that shelf. I got it from the ones
					left
					on this one."
				</p>
				<p>
					That's not what I was worried about. The rice crackers I left on the shelf close to Reimu weren't
					the
					expensive ones. Reimu had the habit of not choosing and going straight for the best stuff I had in
					the
					store. So, the rice cracker Reimu was eating...</p>
				<p>
					"...No, wait. That's not what I'm worried about. It's about the bones."</p>
				<p>
					When I said that, Marisa put her book aside, looking a little upset.</p>
				<p>
					"Alright, enough of that. If ya wanna eat it that bad, I'll cook today," Marisa surprisingly
					declared,
					and went into the kitchen.</p>
				<p>
					Well, I don't know what she's so unhappy about, but knowing Marisa, it must be something simple. She
					did
					say she was going to prepare the food, so she shouldn't be that upset. Besides, we were talking
					about
					the bones.</p>
				<p>
					"So, what's worrying you about the bones, Mr. Rinnosuke?"</p>
				<p>
					"Ah, it's just that the right arm that I picked up yesterday, and the one I picked up today...if you
					look closely, they are the same in every detail! Even bones from twins wouldn't be this similar. It
					looks like they were duplicated."</p>
				<p>
					"So what's bothering you?"</p>
				<p>
					"Don't you get it? Simply put, this right arm and that right arm are from the same individual...I
					think."</p>
				<p>
					"Really? How mysterious. But it might be normal."</p>
				<p>
					"How's that senseless answer going to help?"</p>
				<p>
					Reimu looked like she was giving up as she put her tea down.</p>
				<p>
					"Didn't you say these were from the outside world? Whatever happens in the outside world is out of
					my
					control. Besides, I have no idea about what happens out there. These arms might as well come from a
					human with six arms."</p>
				<p>
					"Even if it was from a human with six arms, it's unnatural for only the arm to cross the Border. The
					Border is your area of expertise, isn't it? I thought you would understand that for only part of a
					body
					to cross over the Border - it's a sign of a youkai. The Border isn't just a wall, you know."</p>
				<p>
					"Really? That's very interesting."</p>
				<p>
					"Yes, really - wait. Are you sure you are a shrine maiden...?"</p>
				<p>
					"Someone I know said that there are those who can go through the Border with just part of their
					bodies
					with no problems...but, of course, she wasn't human herself."</p>
				<p>
					"That's what I'm telling you. This human arm couldn't possibly do that. What did they call this
					again?
					An 'Out of Place Artifact'?"</p>
				<p>
					"That's wrong!" I heard as a rebuttal from Marisa. No, she was in the kitchen, preparing the meal,
					so
					maybe that was just my impression.</p>
				<p>
					"This arm even looks artificial. And it doesn't show any sign of a soul living in it...I don't think
					this arm has experienced a normal life."</p>
				<p>
					Reimu put down her rice cracker, and took the bone for the first time. She was again with the tea in
					one
					hand, so she just exchanged the cracker for the bone. She looked so absent-minded that it seemed
					like
					she could bite the bone by mistake.</p>
				<p>
					"So this arm doesn't have any human feeling to it? So if it came through the Border, I could treat
					it
					the same as the other items that occasionally drift in here. But even so, it is clearly from a
					living
					thing. Even if it is from a human with only right arms. And by looking at it with my 'eye', this
					certainly seems like it's from a human. If I were to take a guess..."</p>
				<p>
					I was going to say "you could imagine someplace like a factory or a laboratory, where arms equal to
					human ones were produced like they were tools," but I stopped myself. These accursed creations would
					be
					such an insult to life that I reconsidered it; I'd rather not think that humans would do something
					so
					foolish.</p>
				<p>
					"I just hope that the humans in the outside world are not doing foolish things" was what I said.</p>
				<p>
					"But don't you make a living out of tools that come drifting in here once in a while? And aren't you
					always mumbling about the progress of the outside world?"</p>
				<p>
					"The body of a living thing...it's not a tool. This store doesn't deal in that."</p>
				<p>
					For a while, nobody spoke a word, so it was pretty quiet.</p>
				<p>
					Reimu was making munching sounds like she was biting into something; I was pretty sure she still had
					the
					bone in her hand, so I looked at her with a shock, but it was the rice cracker. Well...that was
					obvious.
					Speaking of which, it's almost dinner time already, so is it alright for her to be eating?
				<p>
				<p>
					"It's done. Today's chirashi sushi, just as you wanted."</p>
				<p>
					Marisa cheerfully emerged from the kitchen.</p>
				<p>
					"Chirashi sushi? Awfully extravagent, isn't it? So that's why it took so much time...what? 'Just as
					I
					wanted'?"</p>
				<p>
					Marisa had a look on her face like she was making fun of someone. "What, haven't ya been babblin'
					'bout
					it since yesterday? 'Bout how much ya wanted to eat sushi?"</p>
				<p>
					So she said.</p>
				<p>
					"You really did say that," Reimu said while biting her cracker.</p>
				<p>
					"Even you, Reimu...did I say that...?"</p>
				<p>
					"It took s'long 'cuz I couldn't find a fan to cool down the shari [sushi rice]. I was using this hat
					to
					fan it till I 'bout almost dropped dead 'cuz it made no wind."</p>
				<p>
					Ahh, I see. So that's why Marisa was saying "Sushi, sushi!" a while ago...that's just like her.</p>
				<p>
					"What is it? If ya don't eat it soon, my chirashi sushi'll go cold."</p>
				<p>
					"Weren't you working hard to cool it down?"</p>
				<p>
					Reimu quietly put the half-eaten cracker back on its shelf while she spoke:
				<p>
				<p>
					"Sushi, huh? That joke was in bad taste, Marisa."</p>
				<p>
					"Hmph. Bein' told 'I don't want that' by a guy by who shows up in front of someone with shari [bone
					relics] in his hands. Get it? After people die, they become ghosts. Bones are empty shells. If ya
					got a
					problem, go ask it, and that'll be that about the ghosts. If ya want shari, the sushi rice is
					enough."</p>
				<p>
					"...I see. But, because I brought these bones, I got an unexpected banquet today. I wonder if this
					is
					for my good deed of going to mourn at Muenzuka as well."</p>
				<p>
					"Pretty bold for a graverobber, ain't ya."</p>
				<p>
					"My, this is delicious. But you should go wash your hands before you eat, Mr. Rinnosuke; you might
					have
					some Higanbana poison on them."</p>
				<p>
					"You're right. But you touched the bone too, didn't you, Reimu? Did you wash your hands?"</p>
				<p>
					"Of course I did."</p>
				<p>
					"But weren't you in here the whole time?"</p>
				<p>
					"Marisa, could you get me some more tea?"</p>
				<p>
					"What, again? Didn't you drink it?"</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to the sushi Marisa made, the shop regained its usual lively atmosphere - well, more like a
					noisy
					one. And, just as always, I could use my special skill to "completely" stop thinking about that
					bone.</p>
				<p>
					Maybe from tomorrow on, the Higanbana wouldn't look like a strange flower, but a beautiful one. That
					was
					what I was thinking as I washed the poison off my hands in the kitchen.</p>
