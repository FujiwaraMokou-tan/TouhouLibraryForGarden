<br>
This presentation of CoLA utilizes the four fonts included in the Fonts folder.  Please install them by dragging them from there to your C: -> Windows -> Fonts folder.<br>
<br>
Doing so will ensure that you view this iteration of CoLA as the transcriber intended, and are thus able to appreciate it that much more.<br>
<br>
If you're good to go already, the links below should be displayed in a different font from the rest of this ReadMe; if you just installed them while this page was open, hit F5 to refresh this page, which should change it.  Once everything's in the proper font, you've got some choices:<br>
<br>
If you've never read a Touhou work in your life and need a basic introduction to the characters' personalities and what all is going on, you should read both the Foreword and the Character Introductions.<br>
<br>
If you've seen another version of CoLA somewhere, read other Touhou-related works, and/or have a bit of character knowledge, you should read the Transcriber's Foreword to see what is different in this version and why, as it also acts a bit like a FAQ for this version, though you can skip the character intros.<br>
<br>
If you don't care to know the silly little details and already know the characters, you can elect to go directly to the Table of Contents from here as well.<br>
