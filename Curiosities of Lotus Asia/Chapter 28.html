                    The city I live in doesn't get much snow, and what little there is doesn't linger on into spring. So
                    when spring does come, there's not much sense that the city is waking up from winter or anything
                    like that. It's just the season of flowers and pollen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of all the long holidays, spring break is the most liberating. Those entering university or new jobs
                    toss aside their identity as students and savor their temporary freedom. Even those simply moving up
                    a grade are granted all the prestige of being an upperclassman simply by accepting the homework
                    that's only even assigned for the sake of appearances. It's a chance to reset a year that didn't go
                    so well and prepare to retake the challenge. That's what spring break is. And yet despite all that,
                    it's become nothing more than a time for the narrow-minded to make merry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reawakening of life in spring has been corrupted by the partying of the pseudo-free-spirits. Why
                    does the school year start in April anyway? Most countries do this, and while there are others that
                    start after the long summer break, why can't we just follow the calendar and start in January?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, it's not like I hate spring break. Unlike those pseudo-free-spirits who only show up
                    during spring break, I have true freedom. I don't waste my energy being jealous of other people on
                    social media, or getting angry on the author's behalf when someone insults a work I really like.
                    While everyone else is partying away spring break, I can simply travel to another world and enjoy
                    spring the traditional way. The snow-covered Gensoyko I know will have the most beautiful spring,
                    overflowing with life. Or so I thought, but in reality I was greeted with a strange occurrence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So, are the cherry blossoms in the outside world already blooming then?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yup. Winter was pretty cold this year, but it suddenly warmed up as soon as we hit March."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Nice. I wish I could go see the flowers in the outside world someday."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marisa Kirisame and Sumireko Usami were talking at the shrine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, no you don't. Outside world flower viewings aren't any fun at all. It's just
                    pseudo-free-spirits getting smashed and making noise in a public park. Frankly I think calling it
                    anything as elegant as a flower viewing is just rude to the flowers."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Pseudo...free spirits?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, I mean normal people. Normal in the sense that they know that society wouldn't normally let
                    them just drink all day, so they're getting their taste of freedom during the one time they can get
                    away with it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I get it. Well, no I don't."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "They've been liberated from society's norms, so they just make noise like the garbage they are.
                    It's awful."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko was complaining, but seemed happy for some reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm sure the flower viewings in Gensokyo are exquisite."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Eh, I don't know how they do things in the outside world, but I don't think it's much different
                    anywhere, is it? I mean, they call it a 'flower viewing' but it's not like anyone cares about the
                    flowers. It's all about drinking and eating. Dumplings before flowers, y'know? Plus, just making a
                    crazy ruckus, like idiots."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh. That sounds closer to the outside world than I thought."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko looked disappointed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Spring's still a little late at the shrine, but it's been getting there at the foot of the
                    mountain. This ain't really the season for flower viewing, but if you really wanna see spring in
                    Gensokyo, why not take a look around?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...Little by little, the ground was becoming visible under the melting snow. Apparently spring had
                    come to the secondhand store Kourindou a little earlier than the shrine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Looks like I won't be needing to use the stove much longer."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kourindou's Rinnosuke Morichika was already missing that winter gave him an excuse to hole himself
                    up. However, spring changed nothing for him. All that remained was to shut himself up in his cozy
                    store with a good book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinnosuke had gotten a hold of a type of novel he liked. They would describe a murder that could
                    never happen in reality, also known as detective fiction. It was difficult to understand because he
                    wasn't at all familiar with outside world laws, professions, lifestyles, or even the props used, but
                    that itself made them seem fantastic and therefore enjoyable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what especially interested him was how the cops and detectives were often portrayed with a
                    cigarette hanging from their mouths. Those scenes of them putting their thoughts together with a
                    cigarette clenched in their lips perfectly depicted just how difficult the case was. It certainly
                    wouldn't be the same if they were sucking on candy canes or chicken skewers instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, while in Gensokyo there are tobacco pipes, and Kourindou had somehow managed to obtain a
                    hookah, the little rolled up version called a cigarette hardly ever turned up in Gensokyo. He
                    assumed it was because they were too disposable to be considered a tool, and would be more likely to
                    end up in the trash than Gensokyo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, sometimes even extremely rare goods wash up in Gensokyo, and Kourindou stocked a number of
                    authentic cigarettes. Technically they were for sale, but their price was so high that they couldn't
                    be sold. Rinnosuke grabbed one of these expensive cigarettes and lit it with a match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Reading a good novel while my eyes are stinging with tobacco smoke. This, my friend, is a life of
                    luxury. It's time to welcome the spring in style."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ding-a-ling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Welcome. Oh, is that you, Sumireko?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hi there. It's colder than I thought here. It's supposed to be spring, but the ground's still
                    covered in snow."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Unmelted snow is just another sign of spring. It just wouldn't be spring without any snow."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh? Is that how it works? I've always been a city girl."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko then smelled the smoke wafting through the store and furrowed her brow.~
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This smell... is that a cigarette?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Indeed. No one seemed to be coming, so I figured I would pass the time in luxury."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinnosuke proudly took a deep drag on his cigarette. He must not be used to smoking them, as he
                    started choking a little.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Seriously? You smoke? Laaame. You can try to act as cool as you like, smoking these days just makes
                    you look ignorant."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Wh-What?! Really?! So you don't smoke then?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Of course not. I'm underage anyway. The youth these days hardly ever smoke, not even delinquents.
                    The only people who smoke are old men who can't get with the times. And this store doesn't have a
                    non-smoking section, does it? If you don't want your merchandise to stink, maybe you should take
                    that outside? Although I guess with all the laws these days there's nowhere to smoke outside either.
                    There are all sorts of harms from secondhand smoke you know. No surprise that everyone hates it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinnosuke was stunned. He'd been able to handle the unpleasantness of smoking because he thought it
                    looked cool, but now that this girl had been so harsh on it, he didn't feel elegant at all. Noticing
                    that Rinnosuke was obviously feeling down, a flustered Sumireko quickly backtracked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Er, uh, that's what I've read on the net anyway, from the people who want to ban smoking. They'll
                    look for any excuse to beat up on smokers. Personally, I don't mind it that much, and if you want to
                    ruin your own health then go right ahead. Ah, but I guess if you get sick then you're putting a
                    burden on the universal healthcare system..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The downcast Rinnosuke hadn't even been listening to her inept attempt to smooth things over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeling awkward, Sumireko retreated from the store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the human village, not much snow remained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko reflected on her actions while walking down main street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Aw, crap. Why'd I have to go that far? Do I really hate smoking that much?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it irritated her because it brought to mind the image of the pseudo-free students of her
                    hometown using flower viewing as an excuse to party with alcohol and cigarettes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Mr. Rinnosuke doesn't seem like a minor, and it's his own house, so if he wants to smoke it's his
                    own business. What right did I have to scold him? He's even told me before how valuable cigarettes
                    are over here, so why'd I have to ruin his mood like that? Oh I know, maybe I should bring him some
                    cigarettes tonight to apologize."
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, she had no idea how she'd be able to purchase them. Minors can't buy cigarettes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Don't worry about it. Cigarettes aren't that valuable anyway.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Someone was whispering deep in her heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yeah, that's true. I should just forget about this so I can get back to enjoying Gensokyo's
                    spring."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At that moment, she was stopped by a loud voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What are you doing here?! Didn't I tell you to stay put at the shrine?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, huh? So this is where you were heading, Reimucchi?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the Hakurei Shrine Maiden, Reimu Hakurei. She is also in charge of monitoring Sumireko.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You've really gotta listen to me when I tell you to stay put. Who knows what'll happen to you if
                    you just wander all over the place?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "C'mon, Marisacchi practically told me to go exploring and see spring."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh right, Marisa was at the shrine too. Can't she just keep her mouth shut? But fine, whatever, I
                    can take you shopping with me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Aye aye, ma'am!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smoke wafted through Kourindou.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinnosuke had gone through more than a few cigarettes while reading his novels. Just like the
                    detectives in the stories, he would sometimes make a complicated expression and rub his eyes. Even
                    he himself wasn't sure if it was just the smoke stinging his eyes or some other feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The outside world humans sure have gotten dull. They can't even enjoy a luxury like this anymore?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given their price, he'd intended to stop smoking after one cigarette, but instead he'd smoked one
                    after another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ha ha ha, it's such a nice day. Maybe this puts me in the red, but it's worth it for the peace of
                    mind."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You hurt Mr. Rinnosuke?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko had consulted Reimu about it after they bought groceries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yeah. I said a bit too much about his smoking. Like... I might have implied that he should just die
                    already."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hm, yeah. He may not look it, but that guy can be pretty sensitive."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So anyway, I left without apologizing, so I want to do something to make up for it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Eh, I just said he's sensitive, but I think he'll be fine if you leave him alone."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But I'd still feel bad. C'mon, please? Can't you lend me a hand? You're the only one I can turn to
                    here."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "...You're pretty selfish, you know. But fine, I'll think of something."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "All right! I knew I could count on you!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko was ecstatic, but Reimu didn't mind being relied upon either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Then why don't we splurge a little and buy some more food?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What are you planning?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I was thinking of holding a rehearsal flower viewing party at Kourindou. Mr. Rinnosuke likes to
                    stay home, so he hardly ever comes to the shrine for the banquets, but no one hates parties."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Huh? Oh, I see..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko thought about it. Maybe everyone in Gensokyo was the old-fashioned kind of person who loves
                    alcohol and smoking. They probably had a different way of thinking than the youth of today who'd
                    rather spend time alone on the net than go to parties, or were happier accumulating data than
                    sharing experiences with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you want to apologize to Mr. Rinnosuke, how about you host an outside world themed party? I'm
                    sure he'd love that."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "An outside world party, huh...? I'm a minor though."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "A minor? You mean, like, a kid?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Close enough. But it means I don't know much about alcohol, smoking, or parties."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hmm.... That's fine, I guess. I'll just ask someone I know to look into outside world parties for
                    us. You can just say you did it yourself."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Really? Wow, thanks! Friends really are the best thing to own!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Just leave it to me! ...Wait, why I am getting so into this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reimu tilted her head. But no matter how hard she thought, she couldn't come up with a reason for
                    her to be so eager to cooperate with Sumireko.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few days later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The party began in the yard of Kourindou, still covered in snow. That said, the only participants
                    were Sumireko, Reimu, Marisa, and Rinnosuke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This is... quite an extravagant party. Is this how they hold flower viewings in the outside world?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Uh, yeah. This is a type of American party called a barbecue. I see 'em all the time."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Various meats and vegetables were roasting over a giant spit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sorry about the other day. I said too much."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, you didn't have to worry about that. I was just glad to learn more about smoking in the outside
                    world. But, uh, wow. This meat is amazing."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I splurged and bought the good stuff! This is the best you can expect from a high school student
                    living off an allowance. I couldn't buy any alcohol or cigarettes..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I brought the sake. In honor of the new spring, I splurged and bought us a top-class brew!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reimu was in a strangely good mood given that she hadn't drunk any yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ooh, wow. Living the high life today, are we? Maybe I should've bought something too..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marisa was itching to spend her money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In that case, might as well bring out the expensive sake I've been saving for a special occasion!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    And right when Rinnosuke was hooked and decided to splurge today too, something happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [All right!]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko heard a voice in her mind cry out in delight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [I could use a smoke too, while we're at it.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The voice in her mind reminded her of something uncomfortable. Why in the world would I want to
                    smoke?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Good job setting up another day for me to wallow in luxury. Thanks, outsider.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    "?! Who's that? Who's talking to me?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko shouted, but there was no one nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reimu, Marisa, and Rinnsouke stared at her in puzzlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Hey, c'mon now. Don't make such a scene, or you'll ruin this nice party. You can't take back the
                    money you've already spent, so might as well let everyone enjoy it.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sumireko was starting to feel unnerved. She continued searching for the invisible presence, but had
                    no idea where she could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [The name's Joon Yorigami. The plague god who spends everyone's money. I've got you perfectly
                    possessed now.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Perfectly... possessed?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Yeah. To put it simply, I'm haunting you. Everyone around me always thinks they'll be happier by
                    spending money. You using up your entire allowance on expensive meat, the shrine maiden buying that
                    sake she'd never dream of buying normally, and the man taking out Kourindou's treasured sake... it's
                    all due to my power.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    "N-No way... A plague god?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conversation was too crazy to keep up with, and she had no idea if she was really being
                    possessed or not. Rinnosuke and the others were enjoying the extravagant party too much to pay
                    attention to Sumireko.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Ah ha ha! But don't worry. You're just a student, so it doesn't seem like you have much else for me
                    to take. So I'll just enjoy this party and be on my way. Oh, right, and could you not tell the
                    shrine maiden about any of this? That wouldn't do anyone any good.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You okay? Thank goodness you're awake! You just suddenly collapsed, we were all so shocked."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Huh? Was I... asleep?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Sumireko opened her eyes, it was already nighttime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sorry about that! Looks like you got our drinks mixed up and had some sake. Never thought you'd be
                    such a lightweight though."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reimu brought her some water as she said this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I... drank sake...?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    My memories were vague. Anyway, isn't Gensokyo supposed to be my dream? So what happens when I fall
                    asleep here...?
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, I'm fine. My memories are a little fuzzy though. Wait... all the meat's gone!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The meat had vanished while Sumireko was out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well you sure seemed like you were enjoying it!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rinnosuke and the others were relieved that she seemed okay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Don't worry, we saved some for you and set it aside so it wouldn't get burnt. I mean, you did buy
                    us all this high quality meat."
                </p>
                <p>
                    High quality... right. Why would I go beyond my means and buy such expensive food like that? Maybe I
                    saw that strange dream because I was searching for an answer to that. That's what I thought at the
                    time, anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's been quite some time since this happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterward, an incomprehensible incident known as the "Perfect Possession Incident" swept through
                    Gensokyo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thinking back, the incident had already started by then. I wasn't involved in the resolution, but
                    that didn't make it any less frustrating that I had spent all my allowance. On the other hand, you
                    could also say I was lucky to be a mere student, who only had my allowance to lose. With account
                    restrictions like that, I thought that even plague gods could be surprisingly reasonable.
