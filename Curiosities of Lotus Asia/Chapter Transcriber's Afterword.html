Hey there, this is your loyal Touhou material provider, Ace Of Hearts.<br>
<br>
This is the second major project of this nature I have worked on; some of you may be familiar with my downloadable guide to the game "Bunny Must Die & Chelsea and the 7 Devils" last year, though that was not a transcription project, but rather, a self-created game guide.  (If you're interested, both the game and the guide are still available on the Extras page of my website, <a href="http://www.aceofhearts.weebly.com">Ace Of Hearts Simfiles</a>.)  If you are curious, yes, this project too was fueled by coffee (and Love Power).<br>
<br>
I started this transcribing project in Novemeber of 2010, working on and off until finishing in April of 2011, a total of about 6 months or so when I had the motivation to do so.<br>
<br>
It's been a long 27 chapters, and actually, Chapter 27 wasn't even translated until the day I transcribed Chapter 26 - a pleasant coincidence (or would Rinnosuke have guessed that it was predestined to be that way?).<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoyed the insight into the world of the Kourindou shop as much as I enjoyed transcribing it.<br>
<br>
If you were to ask me my favorite chapters, I'd say chapter 4 ("Rain Furnace") because Marisa is the speaker for the first half, and she shows some of her insightful side, and Chapter 9 ("Phantasmal Light & Snow on the Window") because Youmu getting covered in snow is hilarious, though all the chapters are worth reading simply because Rinnosuke has all kinds of insights (some of them rather farfetched, but still) into things we normally don't think too deeply on.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you enjoyed this iteration of "Curiosities of Lotus Asia;" perhaps there will be an opportunity for me to do something like this for the Touhou community again in the future.<br>
