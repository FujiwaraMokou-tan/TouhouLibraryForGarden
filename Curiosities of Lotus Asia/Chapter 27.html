In summer, the night — moonlit nights, of course, but also at the dark of the moon, it's beautiful when fireflies are dancing in a mazy flight. And it's delightful too to just see one or two fly through the darkness, glowing softly. Rain falling on a summer night is also lovely
</p><p>
A rain so heavy that reminds one of fear. A night that is bright, and filled with noise so one never sleeps. A rebellious, tropical night. The summer night Sei Shounagon saw, who could imagine it? I wonder if the landscape floating within my mind is a summer of delusions born from nostalgia.
</p><p>
Still I see them in my dreams. Summer evenings illuminated by the moonlight; the moonless night, when the fireflies scatter at the darkest hour; a powerful and cool shower that washes away the daytime's warmth... Like the summer of a fantastic primitive landscape, as viewed by a peaceful aristocrat through a dream. It was meant to be an escape vacation from the painful summer of reality.
</p><p>
"What's happened here in Gensokyo?! There've been plenty of mysterious happenings so far, but at least the season always matched the time of year."
</p><p>
Summer had finally come around to Gensokyo again, but the ground is covered with snow, and a freezing wind was blowing.
</p><p>
"I can't even tell where the road is under all this- Wah!"
</p><p>
She slipped and fell on the untrodden snowy road. But nevertheless, she raised her voice with a smile.
</p><p>
"This is AMAZING! I knew Gensokyo was weird!"
</p><p>
Paying no mind to the snow that had gotten into her loafers, the girl ran across the snow in her summer clothing.
</p><p>
—Kourindou in the snow. Rinnosuke Morichika and Marisa Kirisame, each dressed warmly, are talking.
</p><p>
"I see, the fairies were rampaging? So that was the reason for the unseasonable snow? But you've already resolved the incident, right? So when's it going to go back to normal, Marisa?"
</p><p>
"Who knows? They said that it'd fix itself on its own over time, but..."
</p><p>
"I'm almost out of wood to burn, so I'll be in trouble if this off-season winter doesn't clear up soon."
</p><p>
It'd been a month since the rainy season ended and, instead of the long-awaited summer arriving, it got cold and started snowing. Rinnosuke had hurriedly set up a heater to fight off the cold, but due to its suddenness he was unable to prepare enough firewood.
</p><p>
"Hey, at least you've got heating. And compared to the endless blizzard in the forest, this is practically paradise. Well, I guess it's still worse than the endless spring at the Hakurei Shrine."
</p><p>
"Oh? So it's always spring at the shrine then?"
</p><p>
"Huh? Didn't I tell you?"
</p><p>
"I was sure that all of Gensokyo was buried in snow."
</p><p>
"That's 'cause you never leave your house. And it's not just the spring at the shrine either, the leaves are already changin' color on the mountain, and- Oh, someone's here."
</p><p>
There was a loud sound from the entrance.
</p><p>
"Uwah! It's soooo cold! I'm gonna freeze to death!"
</p><p>
"Oh, if it isn't Sumireko, glad you made it. But I must say, you're awfully underdressed for the weather."
</p><p>
Sumireko was shivering in her short-sleeved shirt.
</p><p>
"Even my socks are drenched! Ah... but it's so warm in here. I'm coming back to life...
</p><p>
Sumireko took off her shoes and left them next to the wood-burning heater. Then Marisa picked them up.
</p><p>
"Hold on, you were walking through the snow in THESE? There's no cotton linin' in 'em, and the soles are smooth as heck. If you walk on snow with these you'll slip and hurt yourself."
</p><p>
"C'mon, it's summer! How was I supposed to know that it'd be snowing here?!"
</p><p>
She was the human from the Outside World, Sumireko Usami. As Marisa said, those shoes are unsuitable for walking on snow, but she wears the same shoes in winter too. In other words, she's an idiot who isn't worried about slipping.
</p><p>
"Well, these things happen here in Gensokyo."
</p><p>
"Wait, huh? I thought it was really warm here at first, but this stove doesn't have much firepower, does it? I'm already cold again."
</p><p>
Seeing Sumireko trembling with cold, Rinnosuke felt pity for her.
</p><p>
"Ah, I don't have much firewood left so I was trying to ration it. But, well, I hear this temporary winter is going to end soon, so I might as well raise the heat for today."
</p><p>
"You're a lifesaver!"
</p><p>
Sumireko put her hands together in an exaggerated prayer gesture.
</p><p>
"So, what's with the snow? Is something happening in Gensokyo?"
</p><p>
Sumireko asked a reasonable question. Even Marisa thought it was a natural question to ask, but she couldn't help but respond a little wearily.
</p><p>
"There's a lot to talk about, but first I want you to know that this 'someone does something, things are artificially abnormal' stuff happens like clockwork here in Gensokyo. We call them 'incidents'."
</p><p>
"Incidents? I see... wait, artificial? Are you telling me this is manmade snow Mr. Morichika is making with some machine?"
</p><p>
"Manmade snow... the way you put that sounds off, but this incident isn't just about falling snow. There's other stuff, like cherry blossoms blooming and leaves changing color. The seasons are going crazy all across Gensokyo."
</p><p>
"Whaaaat? All across Gensokyo? This is all too sudden, it's hard to believe this is artificial..."
</p><p>
"Well, I said this happens all the time, but to be frank this scale of incident defies common sense here. And actually, so does the lady behind it."
</p><p>
"Wow, so you know who did it then?"
</p><p>
"Yeah. Not only that, it's already been resolved, more or less, so the seasons should go back to normal."
</p><p>
"Oh, so that's how it is. By the way, how do you know so much about this, Marisa? Wait, don't tell me you're the culprit's henchman?
</p><p>
Marisa was starting to look annoyed by this conversation, so Rinnosuke interjected.
</p><p>
"Did no one ever tell you? Marisa Kirisame here is a human who makes her living resolving incidents."
</p><p>
"That's right. Whenever an incident like this pops up I drop everything and go resolve it. I'm what you call a hero of justice."
</p><p>
Marisa took a pose, but Sumireko thought that anyone calling themselves a hero of justice must be pretty lame, so she gave a wry smile."
</p><p>
"Oh, I-I see. So you were a hero of justice then. With that fashion sense, I could've sworn you were just someone celebrating Halloween all year round."
</p><p>
"You're making fun of me, aren't you? This is the uniform of a magician."
</p><p>
"Sorry. To be honest, it looks like the cheap cosplay they sell at a discount store, so- Ack!"
</p><p>
Marisa leapt at Sumireko. With a laugh, Sumireko stopped Marisa's attack. Thinking "good grief", Rinnosuke took the opportunity to ask Marisa a question.
</p><p>
"Incidentally, I'm curious about this incident myself. What kind of person was the culprit, and what was their motive? Would you mind elaborating, Miss Incident Resolution Specialist?"
</p><p>
For whatever reason, Marisa didn't seem at all eager to respond, but perhaps seeing no easy way to change the topic, she began to speak reluctantly.
</p><p>
"—You said a door on your back? Ew, creepy!"
</p><p>
"And the people with those doors had their magical energy go out of control, so it was making their surroundings go haywire. Especially for those like fairies who control nature: because they were going crazy, the seasons were thrown into chaos all over the place."
</p><p>
"Wow, fairies are amazing then!"~
</p><p>
"Hey hey, what're you being impressed for? Fairies ain't amazing. First of all, fairies are just manifestations of the power of nature. In other words, when the fairies go berserk it's nature going berserk. If anything, you should be scared of the folks who can make people go berserk over such a vast... Nah, nevermind."
</p><p>
"? Well, I guess that's true. But doesn't that mean that fairies already had enough magical power to make nature go berserk?
</p><p>
"Hmm, I dunno about that. All I can think of is that they were overflowing with more power than they normally have. I couldn't say where that power came from exactly though. Maybe from the culprit? Or from another world or dimension...? Anyway, the culprit was inside those doors on our backs."
</p><p>
"Ah, so you can go inside. The door on your back."
</p><p>
"Well what'd you expect? They're doors. And inside there was this indescribably creepy world."
</p><p>
Gradually becoming more enthusiastic, Marisa began to speak like she was telling a ghost story.
</p><p>
"...It was a snowy summer morning. A blizzard was raging in the Forest of Magic, and I could barely see a thing, when suddenly there was someone standing in front of me. 'Move, you're in the way!' I said that, but they didn't move. Thinking something was weird, I got closer to take a look, and it was a Jizo statue. 'Oh, it's just a statue? But who would put a statue in a place like this?' While I was wonderin' that, the Jizo statue gave a big smile and suddenly attacked me! 'Uwah! It's a Jizo monster!' I screamed when- Hey, stop that, I'm just getting to the good part."
</p><p>
"B-Back up here. Your tone is fine, and the story's fine, but this is starting to sound made-up. Now I'm just wondering how much of this is real."
</p><p>
"Well, some parts are true, but it's mostly made-up."
</p><p>
"What's with that?!"
</p><p>
Sumireko gave the most cliche possible response.
</p><p>
—This is what Rinnosuke thought.
</p><p>
He couldn't tell how much of Marisa's story was true, and how much was fiction. He could see that she seemed to be avoiding the question. For whatever reason, she didn't want to speak of the incident. After resolving a big incident like this, she'd normally gladly brag about her heroism. It was just a guess, but he had a bad feeling about this.
</p><p>
"Marisa... Did you really resolve the incident?"
</p><p>
"'Course I did. Why would you doubt me?"
</p><p>
"It's just, you seem to be avoiding getting to the heart of the matter."
</p><p>
"Hmm. Well, I... it's true that I resolved the incident. But there are parts I don't wanna talk about..."
</p><p>
Just then, Sumireko looked out the window and became flustered.
</p><p>
"Hey, there's something out there! It's a Jizo with a straw hat and it's walking!"
</p><p>
"Huh?"
</p><p>
Surprised, Marisa and Rinnosuke looked out the window. There, they saw a small girl with braids dressed like a Jizo statue.
</p><p>
"Uwah, it's so warm inside Kourindou. I thought I'd go shopping in the village, but it's so cold out there that I was starting to reconsider."
</p><p>
Her name was Narumi Yadatera. She is an actual Jizo statue living in the Forest of Magic.
</p><p>
"I'm so sorry! I saw you walking through the snow with your hands held in prayer like that, so I thought a straw-hatted Jizo statue had turned up."
</p><p>
"Ahaha, this is Narumi Yadatera. And she really is a Jizo statue."
</p><p>
"What? Seriously?"
</p><p>
With no hesitation at all, Sumireko touched Narumi's body.
</p><p>
"Whaaat? She's soft! If the Jizo statue's not hard and heavy and stony then what's the point?"
</p><p>
"So who's this rude girl?"
</p><p>
"A human from the Outside World."
</p><p>
"What? Th-The Outside World?!"
</p><p>
"Nice to meet you, I'm Sumireko Usami! I'm a Super High School Girl who can freely come and go between Gensokyo and the Outside World!"
</p><p>
She seemed to be imitating Marisa's pose from earlier. Surprised, Narumi turned to Rinnosuke.
</p><p>
"I know you only ever sell useless junk from the Outside World here, but now you've got an Outside World HUMAN in stock? So, how much are you asking?"
</p><p>
Rinnosuke gave a bitter look.
</p><p>
"Narumi. She's not for sale. True, Kourindou deals in goods from the Outside World, but humans are not goods. She's a customer. For now, at least."
</p><p>
"Is that so? I'm sure she'd fetch a high price with youkai. If you look past her poor quality, she's certainly a rare item."
</p><p>
Narumi turned towards Sumireko as she announced her dislike, and laughed.
</p><p>
—A little while later, Marisa, Sumireko, and Narumi had opened up and were having a pleasant chat.
</p><p>
"Wow, so in the Outside World they can make one machine that both heats and cools? I'd love one of those. But how does it work? If it burns fire then it could only warm things up, but if it has ice inside it can only cool things down."
</p><p>
"Probably something to do with vaporization heat, but that's a good question. One sec, let me Google it- Oh, right, I'm outside the service range. I'll look it up later."
</p><p>
"What's that thing?"
</p><p>
"It's my smartphone. It's a device that can make calls, browse the net, look stuff up, check maps, and pretty much do anything. But, well, in Gensokyo it's basically just a watch with a camera."
</p><p>
With the store being turned into nothing more than a lounge, there was no place for me anymore. But I was still bothered by the topic of the incident's mastermind. What would make Marisa not want to talk about it? I could think of three reasons. First, that Marisa was lying about resolving the incident. Second, Marisa had actually been won over by the culprit. Third, the culprit is someone she knows and she's covering for her.
</p><p>
To be honest, all three seemed very possible. But when the circumstances of the incident affect all of Gensokyo to this extent, I think that everyone who lives here has a right to know. I need to ask the evasive Marisa once again. But I just can't find the timing to butt in on their silly girl talk. While I was hesitating though, Narumi changed the subject in precisely the way I needed.
</p><p>
"—Aw, I wish I had an air conditioner. If I had one of those, I'd have been fine even when summer suddenly changed to winter. By the way, Marisa, when is the winter in the Forest of Magic going to end? I thought you told me you resolved the incident."
</p><p>
Yes, this is it! That was my chance to insert myself into the conversation.
</p><p>
"I'd like to ask that again too, Marisa. It seems you don't want to talk about it, but THIS incident at least was a problem for everyone, so I think we deserve to know the truth."
</p><p>
Marisa muttered "Figured this would happen..." with a resigned look and began her explanation.
</p><p>
The incident was caused by the power of a single hidden god. It was a crazy story about her causing an incident that affected all of Gensokyo just to find a servant for herself. The most unbelievable part was how throwing the seasons into disorder wasn't even her goal, it was just a side effect.
</p><p>
"—Oh? So the incident was the work of that one hidden god? So one person alone can have such a great effect on all of Gensokyo? How frightening."
</p><p>
"So both Marisa and I were affected by the magic that created doors on our back without even realizing it. A magic that even I, a Magic Jizo, couldn't detect. How terrifying."
</p><p>
"Wow, so she can have an effect at such long range without even showing herself? There sure are some amazing people in Gensokyo!"
</p><p>
After hearing about the incident, the three of us were shocked. At the same time, we felt both fear and respect for this hypothetical god.
</p><p>
"See, that reaction! That's exactly why I didn't want to talk about this. The whole point of the incident was so she could show off her power. Whoever hears about this is shocked, scared, and inclined to admire her. And that's exactly what she wants!
</p><p>
Marisa sounded frustrated, but perhaps because of the joy of getting this off her chest she continued with crazy stories of being invited to be this hidden god's servant, what was on the other side of the door, and everything else. With each one, the three of them swelled with interest, and there was always something more to talk about. If this was the hidden god's goal, then she had achieved total victory. Probably not even Marisa was especially vexed.
</p><p>
In the end, the Four Seasons Incident that disrupted all of Gensokyo left no victims. Its only lasting consequence was the deeply felt presence of the hidden god. The flower of conversation between this unique trio of magician, outsider, and Jizo continued to bloom. But personally, I was sick of all this endless girl talk and could only stare at the clock. I'm sure the hidden god would have been frustrated if everyone in Gensokyo were people like me. What a disappointment that would have been.
