            The current shrine maiden at the Hakurei Shrine, which lies on the
            border of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hakurei Shrine exists to watch over the Great Boundary which
            ensures Gensokyo's existence, and the shrine maidens of Hakurei
            resolve major incidents for a living (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to previous generations of shrine maidens, her sense of
            danger in addition to her training is lacking, yet her power is
            considerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's defeated multitudes of youkai with her keen intuition and her
            incredible good luck.

            Perhaps as a result of that, strong youkai tend to like her, while

          </p>
          <p>
            However, her opinion regarding youkai is that exterminating them is

            If the Great Boundary were destroyed, either from inside or out,
            Gensokyo would likely not fare well.

          <p>
            Gensokyo relies on the Hakurei Shrine and its shrine maidens to
            continue to exist as it does today.
          </p>
          <p>As a result, no youkai oppose them.</p>

            Due to her easygoing appearance, it's impossible to tell whether she

            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            As it would be dangerous for any youkai to defeat the Hakurei shrine
            maiden, many youkai felt that their existences had become
            meaningless.
          </p>
          <p>And so the spell card rules were introduced.</p>
          <p>
            The spell card rules allow both parties to show off their skills in
            a beautiful competition.
          </p>
          <p>The major points are:</p>
          <p>
            *Spell cards are specially-named techniques, and they must be
            declared upon use.
          </p>
          <p>
            *The number of each parties' spell cards must be determined in
            advance of a duel.
          </p>
          <p>
            *The first party to use all of their spell cards must admit defeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            *The victor is entitled only to what was agreed upon before the
            duel. If they're not interested in what their opponent has to offer,
            they can refuse a duel.
          </p>
          <p>*Winners should generally allow losers a rematch.</p>
          <p>* Always prepare for the unexpected.</p>
          <p>
            Following these rules allows for conflict resolution which is almost
            like a sporting event.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of these rules, it became possible for even
            relatively weak humans to challenge youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, it became possible for youkai to safely defeat the
            shrine maiden without worrying about the consequences.

          </p>
          <p>She's often seen going out to shop in the human village.</p>
          <p>
            If she catches sight of a youkai on the way, she will surely teach
            them a lesson.
          </p>
          <p>In this way, she's different from a usual human.</p>

          <p>
            Although the shrine maiden of Hakurei was initially the only one who
            resolved incidents, these days, there are many imitators who go out
            to resolve incidents as well.

          <p>
            3: "Incident" means a phenomenon that affects all of Gensokyo and is
            of unknown cause. Typically this is due to some youkai's whimsy or
            the doings of a newcomer.

          <p>
            Since the Hakurei Shrine stands on the boundary of Gensokyo from the
            outside world, one can go to the shrine from either world.
          </p>
          <p>But it normally isn't possible to pass between the two worlds.</p>
          <p>
            People from Gensokyo can go only to Gensokyo's Hakurei Shrine, and
            people from the outside world can go only to the outside world's
            Hakurei Shrine.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that the Hakurei Shrine seen from outside is a desolate,
            uninhabited shrine which no one visits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the Great Boundary was created, the shrine was not as empty
            as it is now, but it was also not built up to the same scale as the
            Gensokyo one.
          </p>

            It's said that the Hakurei Shrine in the outside world has mostly

            The Great Barrier is composed of many smaller boundaries, both

            weakening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, the second period of this cycle occurred, and a number of
            smaller incidents sprang up around Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the sort of incident that would resolve itself somehow if

            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Originally, attacking humans was the point of the youkai's
            existence, but since the erection of the Great Barrier it's become
            difficult for them to do so, and they've had to find sources of food
            outside their normal choices. Consequently, the collective willpower
            of the youkai began to fall.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was into this situation that a powerful youkai from outside, a
            vampire, appeared, and quickly amassed a great number of
            subordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, the vampire was defeated through the efforts of the most
            powerful youkai, and a settlement was reached through a contract
            that placed a number of prohibitions on the vampire's activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the more willful youkai found these terms distasteful and
            entered into discussions with the Hakurei shrine maiden.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine maiden, who was also tiring of an uneventful lifestyle,
            agreed to the youkai point of view that some battles were necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of this were the spell card rules, which allowed duelists
            to seemingly stake their lives in individual combat (*4).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that the raucous Scarlet Mist incident caused by that
            vampire was the first time the spell card rules were put to use.
          </p>
