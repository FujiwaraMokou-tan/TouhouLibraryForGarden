            Going through and beyond the Forest of Magic, one will come to a
            small road.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one were to proceed along this road, they would finally reach
            Muenzuka.
          </p>
          <p>
            When autumn comes around, the road becomes completely covered with
            higan flowers, dyeing the road a deep red.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muenzuka is a graveyard for those without relatives and those who
            committed suicide in the outside world, a place where many end up
            after wandering aimlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This area is a place where even the humans living on the furthest
            outskirts of Gensokyo never approach, for the strong connection
            between that and the outside world can create openings at any time
            (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            As those who've committed suicide walk along this path when it is
            covered with higan flowers, the toxins will swirl around their
            bodies, something wondrous yet unpleasant takes place, in that their
            will to survive will become rejuvenated.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then, deciding to try once more, they will turn and retrace
            their steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why this road has been called the "Road of Reconsideration."
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, this road is a place where encountering a human from the
            outside world is very likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, there are also nasty youkai who lie in wait, hoping
            for a meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            To have gone to the trouble of enduring the struggles of
            reconsideration, and just when one is thinking about maybe once
            again trying their best, being preyed upon by a youkai is no kind of
            repayment or reward (*2).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: Connections to the netherworld are also easily created here,
              as this is a place where several barriers overlap and intersect.
            </p>
            <p>
              *2: Depressed people, spiteful people bearing grudges, criminals
              and the like are the favorite foods of youkai. There are plenty of
              those kinds of people here.
