            Even though youkai live long, naturally, new ones come into being as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>Medicine Melancholy is one of these newborn youkai.</p>
          <p>She was a discarded doll changed into youkai after a long time.</p>
          <p>Her form is that of a large doll used in ventriloquism.</p>
          <p>
            It is believed that the original doll from where she came was
            roughly that size.
          </p>
          <p>Even after becoming a youkai, her body is still that of a doll.</p>
          <p>
            It is believed that the ability to manipulate poison was naturally
            attained by being left on the Nameless Hill (*1), where numerous
            lilies-of-the-valley bloom, for a long time.
          </p>
          <p>She pours poison in food.</p>
          <p>She uses poison to manipulate humans.</p>
          <p>
            She's a threat to humans that are easily affected by poison (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a young youkai, her experience and knowledge is overwhelmingly
            shallow.
          </p>
          <p>She possesses less knowledge than humans.</p>
          <p>
            Because of this, whether she's dealing with a human or youkai, she
            doesn't know the meaning of holding back.
          </p>
          <p>She also can't see how strong her opponent is.</p>
          <p>Therefore, she is fearsome.</p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: It is a hill that goes by the name Nameless Hill. Mentioned
              later.
            </p>
            <p>
              *2: Drinking too much sake is poison for the body. If you are
              offered sake while in a bad condition, you need the courage to
              reject.

            "I thought it was a doll, but when I touched it my skin became
            inflamed." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>Merely touching her will cause a bad reaction to one's body.</p>
          <p>Terrifying.</p>
          <p>
            "The other day, this small youkai dropped by the village, but
            immediately ran away. Was that really a youkai?" (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>It is thought that she has not seen a large number of humans.</p>
          <p>However, you must never chase after her.</p>
          <p>She may return to spread a poisonous fog over the village.</p>

            "I saw a small doll hopping happily at the Nameless Hill. I wonder

          </p>
          <p>
            Since she gives the impression that she's defenseless, that just
            shows that her experience as a youkai is shallow.
          </p>
          <p>You shouldn't carelessly startle her until she matures.</p>

          <p>The type of poison is unknown.</p>
          <p>
            There are many types of poison: flower's poison, snake's poison,
            bee's poison, spider's poison, poison that causes inflammation just
            by touching it and poison that knocks you unconscious just by
            whiffing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of that, if one is affected by her poison there is no
            definite treatment method.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will probably understand the true terror of poison when you
            confront this youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even youkai suffer after being showered in the strong poison just by
            being near her.
          </p>
          <p>At this point, it's not the time to be thinking about fighting.</p>
          <p>
            Until this youkai develops mentally, refrain from exterminating her.
          </p>
          <p>Her current weak point is her shallow experience.</p>
          <p>
            She hates humans, but if you skillfully manage your words, you can
            deceive her easily.
          </p>
          <p>Pretend to be a human that hates humans.</p>
          <p>
            The strength of her poison is fearsome, and can leave aftereffects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poisons that remain latent for a long time and cause delayed effects
            (*3) are also dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>You must avoid fighting her at all costs.</p>
