          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <p>There's a special legend about the Bamboo Forest of the Lost.</p>
          <p>
            It's said that a group of specialized youkai exterminators, separate
            from the villagers, lived hidden there, with the ability to move
            quickly, yet silently, and use various kinds of sorcery like youkai,
            and went after and exterminated particularly strong and dangerous
            youkai, though their existence has been questioned recently (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with the recent discovery of Eientei in the Bamboo Forest
            of the Lost, the possibility of such a group's existence seems more
            plausible.
          </p>
          <p>
            About that time, I encountered a person who is probably a descendant
            of such a group.
          </p>
          <p>That person is Fujiwara no Mokou.</p>
          <p>
            She is human, but they say she never ages and cannot be destroyed.
            Because she has lived for so long, she has learned various kinds of
            sorcery, and can be said to be on equal footing with youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because she's human she exterminates youkai, she won't attack
            without reason, and primarily rescues lost humans from the youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said she doesn't mingle with youkai or the humans from the
            village, but primarily lives hidden in the Bamboo Forest of the
            Lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked about her connection to the legendary exterminators, she
            feigns ignorance.
          </p>
          <p>
            She doesn't seem to concern herself much with humans, and leaves
            without saying a word even when she rescues lost people.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>1: They're often thought of as a group of ninja.</p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Ability</p>
            </b>
          </div>
       
          <p>She possesses a body that doesn't age and cannot be destroyed.</p>
          <p>She is a so-called immortal.</p>
          <p>
            Her body heals unusually quickly, and even severe injuries will be
            completely healed in a matter of days (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as she still feels the pain of her injuries it is called
            the melancholy of immortality.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that humans can only achieve immortality by becoming a
            celestial, but somehow she has managed to become immortal through
            other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            She seems to appear before others more often recently, but it's
            unknown as to why.
          </p>
          <p>
            She never speaks even when posed this question, so it remains a
            mystery.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            2: It's said she could regenerate if even a single hair remains.
          </p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Watchguard</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            At this point, she seems to have come into some sort of agreement
            with the villagers, and will serve as an escort through the bamboo
            forest to anyone who asks.
          </p>
          <p>
            She can be relied on to lead villagers to Eientei such as in the
            case of sudden illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            She will lead you to Eientei without fear of being lost or accosted
            by youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time, she'll remain fairly reticent (*3) about herself,
            but she seems to be happy to listen to others talk about their own
            affairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            She may be immortal, but since she's not a celestial, her way of
            thinking is similar to most humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may be able to learn more as she becomes more accustomed to
            speaking with others.
          </p>

            3: All she says is, "I'm a health nut that runs a yakitori stand."
