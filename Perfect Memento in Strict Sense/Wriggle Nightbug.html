            When it comes to youkai humans find unpleasant, Wriggle Nightbug is
            a good example.
          </p>
          <p>
            As to why she's considered unpleasant, she always appears with a
            large number of bugs and can control them at will.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just imagine being simultaneously attacked by centipedes,
            caterpillars, moths, spiders, and cave crickets.
          </p>
          <p>It makes your hair stand on end.</p>
          <p>This youkai appears similar as a human child.</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, she doesn't look completely like a bug. She only has
            antennae and wings but other than that, she doesn't look any
            different from a human (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Wriggle is a bug youkai, but to be exact, she's a firefly youkai.
          </p>
          <p>Fireflies, unlike most bugs, are popular with humans.</p>
          <p>
            Since this type of bug can avoid being exterminated by humans, it's
            easy for them to mature into youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, butterflies are similarly quite popular with humans, so
            it's easy for them to become youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long ago, bug youkai were equal to oni and tengu in terms of
            inspiring fear, but lately they've lost that prestige.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that this bug youkai, who could be called the bugs' leader,
            has the appearance of a young girl could be considered a symbol of
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason why the bugs' power has radically declined needs to be
            investigated.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: She likely needs to take on a human shape in order to make it
              more difficult for humans to exterminate her.

            "I lifted up a big stone and there were a whole bunch of bugs under

          <p>
            This may not have much to do with this youkai, but it's technically
            a report regarding bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            "There were a clump of centipedes under the overhang of my roof. I
            wish they'd go away." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>This may not have much to do with this youkai.</p>
          <p>
            "There was a cave cricket at my back door. I hate those things."
            (Anonymous)

          <p>This has nothing to do with this youkai.</p>

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>The thing that makes bugs frightening is their numbers.</p>
          <p>
            Individually they don't have much power, but when they come in large
            groups they're hard to deal with.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is particularly true for bugs such as hornets; while killing
            one or two means nothing, if they land one sting it can kill a
            human.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most effective countermeasure is building a fire and using
            fumigation in order to keep bugs away from a large area (*2).
          </p>
          <p>Also, they're generally weak to the cold.</p>
          <p>
            They're active from spring through fall, but they almost never show
            up during winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although her control of bugs is frightening, there isn't much that
            is dreadful about facing Wriggle Nightbug herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're trying to exterminate youkai, your best bet is to go after
            this youkai during winter when she's alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, among the bugs that this youkai uses, the ones you need to be
            most careful of are the harvest mites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harvest mites are devil bugs that can't be seen by the human eye,
            and you don't even notice that you've been bitten.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, small black bite marks will appear, but by then it's too
            late; you'll get a high fever and collapse, and there is a high
            probability of death.
          </p>
          <p>There is no effective treatment.</p>
          <p>
            If Wriggle doesn't seem to have any bugs with her and yet looks
            highly confident, that is when she is the most dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>She could have harvest mites lurking around her (*3).</p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *2: Recently, there's also a convenient chemical known as
              insecticide.
            </p>
            <p>*3: Or maybe fleas.</p></i
