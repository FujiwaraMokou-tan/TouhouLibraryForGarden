            Since yuurei are formless, most people are unable to distinguish
            between normal ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Konpaku family are not simple yuurei, but are a lineage of
            half-human, half-yuurei.
          </p>
          <p>Her appearance does not differ from that of normal humans.</p>
          <p>
            Youmu's thought patterns are similar to a normal human's for the
            most part, but it's said her body temperature is a bit lower.
          </p>
          <p>Her lifespan is far longer than that of normal humans.</p>
          <p>
            This is probably because she is half yuurei, which do not have
            distinct lifespans.
          </p>
          <p>A large yuurei accompanies her human form.</p>
          <p>
            As this yuurei has human and yuurei attributes, this is one way to
            easily distinguish her from normal humans.
          </p>
          <p>The large yuurei can act on its own.</p>
          <p>
            Also, unlike normal yuurei, its body is not particularly cold to the
            touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youmu serves as the gardener for Hakugyokurou(*1) in the
            Netherworld, and is also a live-in sword instructor, but lately she
            can frequently be seen in this world(*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Though, it is likely because lately(*3) the barrier between this
            world and the next has weakened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many theories have been put forth to explain the weakening of this
            barrier, but its true cause is the whim of the youkai of boundaries.
          </p>

            She possesses superior swordsmanship, and is a master of the
            two-handed technique.
          </p>
          <p>The two swords she uses are called Hakurouken and Roukanken.</p>
          <p>The longer sword is Roukanken.</p>
          <p>
            It's believed that Roukanken was forged by youkai, and it's too long
            to be used by normal humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that it has the power to kill ten spirits in one stroke,
            but as one cannot actually kill spirits(*4), it's unknown if this is
            true(*5).
          </p>
          <p>
            The other sword, Hakurouken, is the ancestral sword of the Konpaku
            family, and it's said to have the power to dispel the confusion of
            those it cuts.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is, using it on yuurei will send them to nirvana, and using it
            on humans will cause them discomfort and a bit of pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exact details of its function are unclear, but it can only be
            handled by the Konpaku family.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>*4: Normally they are sent to nirvana or disappear.</p>

          <p>She lives in the Netherworld in Hakugyokurou.</p>
          <p>
            She wakes up early in the morning before the mistress of the estate
            to patrol the gardens.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the day she tends to the gardens and trains her sword
            technique, and will go out on errands if called.
          </p>
          <p>
            At night, she patrols once again, and supposedly goes to bed only
            after confirming that the mistress has done so.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she were to discover an intruder at this time, she would surely

            It's questionable why living humans would go to the Netherworld to
            visit.

          <p>
            "She comes shopping here a lot. It's like someone is coming to take
            you to the next world, and it feels pretty weird." (Anonymous)

          <p>
            It's possible to come to mutual understanding with her, so conflict
            can be avoided through discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like other youkai, she doesn't assault humans without a purpose,
            such as food or boredom.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't challenge, provoke or put her in a blatantly
            disadvantageous situation, she will likely not attack you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the situation looks threatening, she will not fight anyone
            lacking in training, so that will at least make her go easy on you.

          <p>
            If you've done nothing wrong, you can probably talk your way out of
            a battle.

          <p>
            Even if you've clearly done something wrong, things might work out
            somehow if you offer a proper apology.

            Now, what should one do in the unlikely event of being attacked by
            her?

            All normal human can hope to do in such a circumstance is offer a
