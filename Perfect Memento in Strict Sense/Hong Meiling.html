            Hong Meiling is one of the youkai that lives in the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            She works as the gatekeeper, and thus meets humans more than the
            other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is skilled in martial arts, and doesn't have many unusual
            youkai-like powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her appearance is no different than a human's. She wears a
            Chinese-style outfit, and moves lightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other youkai, she does not specialize in a single ability,
            but is well-rounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of that, she's not particularly strong compared to other
            youkai, but she has no blind spots when facing humans.
          </p>
          <p>Nor has she any particular weak point.</p>
          <p>
            It can be assumed that she was given the job of gatekeeper because
            of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is unusually human-like for a youkai, and if you talk to her
            while she is on the job, she will make idle chatter or complain
            about whatever is on her mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            She may threaten you with words, but as long as you don't try to
            break through the gate, she will rarely attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            You would even think that the person you're talking to might be a
            human.
          </p>

            "The Scarlet Devil Mansion is terrifying, but thanks to that
            gatekeeper, it feels friendly." (Tofu shop owner)
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, the fact that terrifying youkai live inside doesn't change.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In the morning, when I looked towards the Scarlet Devil Mansion, I
            saw the gatekeeper dancing a strange, slow dance." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>It is most likely Tai Chi Chuan.</p>
          <p>You must not disturb her.</p>
          <p>
            "When I passed the Scarlet Devil Mansion at noon, I saw that the
            gatekeeper was sleeping." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>She's most likely having a siesta.</p>
          <p>You must not disturb her.</p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Since her meals are provided by the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she isn't
            a youkai to be feared at all.
          </p>
          <p>As long as you don't provoke her, she isn't dangerous.</p>
          <p>
            You should refrain from breaking through the gate, or sneaking
            through while she's sleeping.
          </p>
          <p>She'll attack you without mercy.</p>
          <p>
            But even if that happens, if you immediately apologize and retreat,
            she won't chase you.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when it comes to extermination, things become extremely
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a master of martial arts, she is highly proficient in battle, and
            doesn't have any apparent weak points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, since she seldom moves from the Scarlet Devil Mansion, other
            youkai may come and support her (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to exterminate her, the only way is to request a one on one
            battle with a time limit (*3), and win by overpowering her through a
            direct attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, she may be a good opponent to test your skills (*4).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *2: In reality, youkai helping other youkai is rare. Most just
              snicker while watching the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
              *3: Humans are at a physical disadvantage against youkai, so a
              formal match is important.
            </p>
            <p>
              *4: In fact, she always gets such challengers. It is said that the
              mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion enjoys watching these
              matches, too.
