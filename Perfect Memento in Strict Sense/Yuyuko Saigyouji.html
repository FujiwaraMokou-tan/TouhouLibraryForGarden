            The mistress of the Saigyouji family who resides at Hakugyokurou in
            the Netherworld.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that she died over 1000 years ago, so she is a ghost with
            an abnormally long lifespan (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Impressed by her unwillingness to hold grudges and her ability to
            control spirits, she was appointed by the Yama to manage the souls
            of the dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            In return, she was permitted eternal residence in the Netherworld.
          </p>
          <p>Her appearance is no different from those of humans.</p>
          <p>
            It is said that the color of her skin and hair is paler than when
            she was alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            As her body is sealed away within Hakugyokurou, it is said to be
            impossible to hold a burial ceremony for her.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, she will live (*2) eternally in the form of a ghost.</p>
          <p>
            Her personality is so extraordinarily carefree that it is said she
            doesn't remember how long she's been in the Netherworld.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems she doesn't even remember what she had for breakfast (*3).

            The ability to manipulate death means just as it says, the ability
            to kill someone with no resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they're dead, she would be able to control their spirit as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>Nothing good can come out of challenging her.</p>

          <p>
            Her father was a widely adored poet, and eventually fell into
            eternal rest beneath a cherry tree as he wished.
          </p>
          <p>
            His adoration continued after his death, and now he has ascended
            into heaven as a god.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year some grand personage would die beneath that tree when it
            was in full bloom, just like Yuyuko's father.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tree continued to absorb their blood. It turned into a youkai
            cherry tree with the ability to lure people to their death, and it
            became to be called the Saigyou Ayakashi.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that the Saigyou Ayakashi is now kept in Hakugyokurou in
            the Netherworld, sealed with the bodies of countless people,
            including Yuyuko, who sleep beneath it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, it never reaches full bloom.

          </p>

          <p>This is a story of twenty or thirty years ago.</p>
          <p>
            The number of spirits in the Netherworld increased due to limits on
            ascension (*4).
          </p>
          <p>
            Gradually, the already-vast Netherworld was becoming overcrowded, so
            she allowed them to inhabit various places (*5) in the world of the
            living as they were waiting to reincarnate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The places she chose included closed schools and hospitals,
            abandoned buildings, and places people don't usually visit, but some
            curious person on the outside caught sight of one of the ghosts, so
            people started flocking to these places (*6).
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the Yama became aware of this plan and decreed that
            ghosts shouldn't be seen, so it was put to rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the Yama increased the size of the Netherworld, thereby
            removing the necessity for the emigration plan.
          </p>
          <p>It's said that the Netherworld today is larger than Hell.</p>

            The flowers in the Netherworld are extremely popular even among the

            First of all, you will likely not meet her under normal
            circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            She stays in the Netherworld most of the time, and if she has
            business in Gensokyo, she usually has one of the phantoms go in her
            stead.
          </p>
          <p>However, there is one exception.</p>
          <p>You can speak with her after your death.</p>
          <p>
            Normally when you die, after you travel down the Road of Liminality,
            cross the Sanzu river, and receive the judgement of the ten kings at
            Higan, even if you've done no wrong, you go to the Netherworld and
            await reincarnation or enlightenment.
          </p>
          <p>You will definitely see her there.</p>
          <p>
            Surely something dreadful will await you if you manage to incur her
            wrath.
          </p>
          <p>
            She will command her servant Konpaku to sever the circle of
            transmigration with her sword, and if she sends you back to Higan,
            you'd surely be sent to Hell.
          </p>
          <p>It's probably best to read about her before you die.</p>
