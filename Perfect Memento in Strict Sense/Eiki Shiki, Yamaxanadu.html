          <p>One of the many Yamas.</p>
          <p>
            As she is in charge of judging the dead of Gensokyo, she is the Yama
            with the closest ties to us(*1) .
          </p>
          <p>
            Since she is extremely preachy and is never mistaken about anything,
            she appears a little hard to approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, her teachings are basically for the benefit of the people
            of Gensokyo, so she wants us to listen to her obediently.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Yama is famous in Gensokyo, and particularly long-lived youkai
            have been helped by her at least once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, youkai feel uncomfortable around Yamas, so whenever a
            Yama comes to Gensokyo, all youkai go into hiding.
          </p>
          <p>In this sense, Yamas are allies of honest people.</p>
          <p>
            Moreover, whenever a living person's karma is so bad that it becomes
            certain that he will go to Hell, she will go directly to warn that
            person during her work break, and may even urge the person to better
            himself(*2).
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*1: Yamaxanadu is actually a job title at the Ministry of Right
              and Wrong. The meaning is literal: the Yama of Paradise.</i

          </p>
          <p>
            <i

              receive.</i

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Cleansed Crystal Mirror</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>A mirror that the Yamas possess.</p>
          <p>By looking into the mirror, they see all your past deeds.</p>
          <p>
            Although the mirror enables the Yamas to make fair judgments, it
            brings about weariness as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            In front of the mirror, privacy is even less than worthless, and
            they can learn as much personal information as they please. It is
            one hellish (*3) device, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mirror's size varies among Yamas, but it is said that hers is as
            large as a hand mirror.
          </p>

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Rod of Remorse</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>The rod which the Yamas always carry with them.</p>
          <p>
            This is the rod on which she writes the nature of the offense and
            then beats the guilty.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who have done wrong are beaten many, many times in direct
            proportion to their sins, and she keeps beating them until they
            repent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weight of rod is equal to the weight of the sin written on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incidentally, sin are distinct from the living world's crimes, and
            have nothing to do with whether or not they are based on any law.
          </p>
          <p>Sins are determined purely at a Yama's discretion.</p>
          <p>
            At one time, one rod was used per ghost, but after considering the
            influence on the environment, now it is made of a new material which
            can be written on many times.
