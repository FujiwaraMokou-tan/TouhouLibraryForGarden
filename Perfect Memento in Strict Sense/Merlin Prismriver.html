            Technically speaking, poltergeists are not yuurei, but there are no
            other appropriate classifications for them so they are described
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Merlin Prismriver is the middle sister of the Prismriver
            Ensemble(*1), and her forte is the trumpet.
          </p>
          <p>She is the star of their performances, standing out the most.</p>
          <p>She has many fans.</p>
          <p>She looks just like a human.</p>
          <p>
            Of the three sisters, she is the tallest and her hair is the
            brightest, and she often takes center stage at live events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trumpet she holds is said to be the yuurei of a fearful trumpet
            that's taken the blood of many jazz trumpeters(*2), but it's unknown
            if this is true or not.
          </p>
          <p>It is unclear how a trumpet would suck the blood of the living.</p>
          <p>
            She has an incredibly cheerful personality and is never seen
            depressed.
          </p>
          <p>She's known to sometimes blurt out incomprehensible words.</p>
          <p>The sounds she creates are sounds that uplift the spirit.</p>
          <p>
            People who are overly influenced by her sounds will do things such
            as break out into dancing, or become unable to hold a coherent
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>It might be perfect for those suffering from depression.</p>
          <p>
            Usually the Prismriver Sisters perform as a group, but Merlin can
            also be seen acting independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems she holds solo concerts, but going to see such a
            performance may be dangerous for the reasons outlined above.
          </p>

            "On my way to the lake, I could hear the sound of brass instruments
            from far off." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>It was thought to be the sounds of Merlin practicing.</p>
          <p>It may also have been a call for a tengu assembly.</p>
          <p>
            "I went to see one of her solo performances, but it was a brass
            ensemble. Most of the time, it wouldn't be possible for one
            person..." (Cheerful ghost)
          </p>
          <p>
            The instrument she uses is symbolic, so you shouldn't think that
            sound actually comes out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not well understood where the notes actually come from, but
            since they seem to actually be the yuurei of notes, they probably
            come from close by.
          </p>
          <p>"What? Merlin isn't the leader?" (Anonymous)</p>
          <p>
            She isn't human, so something horrible might happen to you if you
            say things like that too often.
          </p>

            She is very friendly to both humans and youkai, so you have nothing
            to fear from her.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's hard to hold a conversation with her alone, so refrain
            from talking to her if you see her alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a phantom, her behavioral principles are different from those of
            humans, so while it's not impossible, mutual understanding is very
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be unfortunate to say the wrong thing and have her
            misunderstand you as spoiling for a fight(*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Prismriver sisters themselves are fairly powerful, and the
            Prismriver Ensemble has many fans, so there is little hope of
            winning if you cross them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the sound of a trumpet can carry quite far, so if you
            happen to hear it from far off, take care not to listen too closely.
          </p>
          <p>It can affect your spirit.</p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *3: Such misunderstandings are common due to difficulty in
              communication. Even praise can be dangerous.
