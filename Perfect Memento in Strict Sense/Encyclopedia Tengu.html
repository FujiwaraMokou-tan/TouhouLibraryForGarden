          <p>Deified youkai who live on the mountain.</p>
          <p>
            These extremely well-known youkai have existed since ancient times,
            predating even Gensokyo, and formed a peculiar society where they
            lead their reclusive lifestyles.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are various types of tengu: the tengu boss, Tenma; the
            management types, Great tengu; the nimble information corps, Crow
            tengu; the ones who specialize in business work, Hanataka tengu; the
            mountain's defense force, White Wolf tengu; and the printers,
            Yamabushi tengu.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, they look the same as humans, but there are extremely
            large tengu such as the Great tengu, and extremely proud ones such
            as the Hanataka tengu, who always have their nose in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            As can be seen from their advanced civilization, tengu are far more
            intelligent than humans, and are very social.
          </p>
          <p>
            On an individual basis, they have very strong physical and sorcerous
            abilities that compare favorably to any youkai in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, they can fly extremely fast, and there are few, if
            any, who can match their speed (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            One characteristic of tengu is that they are generally cheerful,
            heavy drinkers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they drink sake, they don't hold back in terms of quantity.
            It's said that as a greeting, they'll drink 18 liters of sake in one
            gulp.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also have a strong sense of community, and if one of their
            friends are attacked, they'll certainly react with hostility.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an intruder appears on the mountain, they'll quickly show up in
            force to remove them, which is a characteristic not seen in other
            youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, if there's an incident, they'll show up with their amazing
            speed, take a photograph and turn it into an article, then print and
            publish it.

          </div>

          <p>
            The wind that occurs in the wake of a tengu is strong enough to send
            a child flying.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't happen often, but it's said that if you anger a tengu,
            you'll be annihilated by a tornado.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's even more frightening is that they'll spread half-truths and
            weird rumors.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are cases where the tengus' rumors will literally become the
            wind's rumors that they even reached human ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereby, it becomes difficult to properly notify the village
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because this is something against which there is no complete
            defense, there is nothing more dreadful than this.

          <p>First, you must not go to the mountain unprepared.</p>
          <p>Tengu strongly detest trespassers on their territory.</p>
          <p>
            There's honestly no way to defend against the rumors on the wind, so
            even if they circulate strange rumors, all you can do is live your
            life assuming that other people will think "That's just a rumor."
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the rumors are complete lies, others will think "If it's
            'that person' then maybe...", and will make you feel guily
            regardless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the paparazzi photography is fearsome, but you just have to
            bear with it (*2).
