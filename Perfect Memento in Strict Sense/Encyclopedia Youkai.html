          <p>
            There are many types of youkai with extremely varied powers. Some
            races have a great number that are all categorized under a certain
            name, while others can be as few as a single member.
          </p>
          <p>
            These unique youkai are not called by whatever individual species
            they may be, but simply "youkai."
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the youkai in Gensokyo fall into this "youkai (*1)" section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rarely if ever is there any commonality in their appearance,
            ability, character, danger level, or times and places of activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just about the only thing in common between youkai is that they
            attack and prey upon humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are definitely exceptions, but many fall towards this trend.
          </p>
          <p>*Youkai have longer lifespans than humans.</p>
          <p>
            *Youkai have stronger bodies than humans, so even if they're split
            into five parts, they heal right away.
          </p>
          <p>
            *Youkai are more easily affected by belief than humans, and as a
            result spiritual damage can cause fatal wounds.
          </p>
          <p>*Youkai generally do not move in groups.</p>
          <p>*Youkai only think of themselves.</p>
          <p>Youkai are the most dangerous enemies to humans.</p>
          <p>
            However, since they are rather varied, one must be informed of each
            of their traits before heading out to exterminate them.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: It might be confusing, but youkai as a race is similar to the
              "Others" section of a graph. I suppose there are quite a few
              graphs where "Others" is the largest category.

          <p>Humans have no greater enemy than youkai.</p>
          <p>Youkai attack humans for food.</p>
          <p>However, most do not attack when they are full and satisfied.</p>
          <p>
            If the human population drops, youkai will face trouble as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            They do not eat only humans, but animals, birds, fish, vegetables,
            fruits, alcohol and other things humans normally eat.
          </p>
          <p>Still, they consider humans a delicacy above all else.</p>
          <p>They steal crops and livestock as well.</p>
          <p>This is also serious problem.</p>

          <p>
            Unless one thoroughly trains in fighting against them, youkai
            extermination is difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youkai have a history of being physically stronger than humans, and
            trying to fight them may quickly end up as feeding them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the reason most youkai attack humans is because they need
            prey.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why one should offer something else to eat in place of
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Offering a cow will save you from being attacked for a while.</p>
          <p>
            There are many that have a strong sense of duty, and will befriend
            those who do not turn against them.
          </p>
          <p>But exterminating youkai is a different story.</p>
          <p>
            Humans regularly perform exterminations, but this is a custom passed
            down from ancestors.
          </p>
          <p>In Gensokyo, humans must exterminate youkai (*2).</p>
          <p>There are those that specialize in youkai extermination.</p>
          <p>
            For example, the Hakurei shrine maiden is the most well-known
            specialist.
          </p>
          <p>
            In extermination, one does not use weapons that cause physical
            damage. Weapons with an "origin" are more preferable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youkai are weak to spiritual attacks such as names or traditions.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *2: It is said that the balance of Gensokyo will crumble if they
              do not.
