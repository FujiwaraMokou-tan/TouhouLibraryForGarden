            Rich in knowledge, the wisest of the therianthrope is Keine
            Kamishirasawa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon seeing the full moon, she will transform into a hakutaku (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            A hakutaku is a youkai which appears to virtuous rulers at the
            beginning of their reign, warning them of future calamities and
            guiding them on the path of righteousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            She can erase history when human, and when she becomes a hakutaku,
            she can create history.
          </p>
          <p>Gensokyo's history is one created by her (*2).</p>
          <p>
            Regarding history, things do not become history merely by happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things do not become history unless someone records it as history.
          </p>
          <p>
            She can fabricate history that didn't happen, or conversely, erase
            from history incidents which actually did happen.
          </p>
          <p>History is reality, seen from a single point of view.</p>
          <p>
            It would not be too much to say the power of the hakutaku is used to
            create favorable histories for those virtuous rulers.
          </p>
          <p>
            She lives in the human village, where she runs a temple school and
            records history there every day (*3).
          </p>
          <p>Such is her profession.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>1: Incidentally, it's an acquired characteristic.</p>
          <p>
            2: The Hieda family's Gensokyo Chronicles is beyond her powers.
            Thus, it not her history, but ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            3: She also has close relations with the Hieda family. The vast
            quantity of information the Hieda family has collected over a
            thousand years is useful for her lessons.

            "The temple school lessons are difficult to understand, tedious, and
            really boring! Can't you do something?" (Leader's son)

          <p>She is not good at entertaining others.</p>
          <p>

            daughter)
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were the one teaching, it would certainly be more interesting.
          </p>
          <p>But a lesson is meaningless if it's merely interesting.</p>
          <p>
            "No, that's not what I meant. As a student!" (Florist's daughter)
          </p>
          <p>Well, I already know everything she teaches...</p>
          <p>Most of the lessons are a summary of my records, anyway...</p>

            Although she's a little stubborn, since she has no ill will towards
            humans, there's no need to be afraid.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you forget your homework, a fearful punishment is
            waiting (*4).
          </p>
          <p>
            She is often seen, since she normally lives in the human village.
          </p>
          <p>At that time, you should greet her.</p>
          <p>It seems that she dislikes people who are discourteous.</p>
          <p>Also, she becomes a hakutaku on the night of the full moon.</p>
          <p>
            As she has a month of work on which to catch up at this time, she is
            often on edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, refrain from visiting her on the night of the full moon
            (*5).

          <hr />
          <p>4: Such as a headbutt.</p>
          <p>5: When she has grown horns, her headbutts are painful.</p>
