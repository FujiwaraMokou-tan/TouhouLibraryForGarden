				<p class="textTitles">Characteristics</p>
			  </b>
			</div>
			
			<p>Therianthropes are those who normally live as humans, but become youkai under certain circumstances. 
			<p>When they are living as humans, this does not mean they are pretending to be human. Rather, they are practically no different from humans. (*1) 
			<p>When they become animals, though, their physical abilities abruptly increase, and they become as powerful as beasts. 
			<p>However, many of them retain their memories from being human, so they are often more intelligent than beasts. 
			<p>While they rarely attack humans, their habitat range is nearly exact to that of humans, so caution is necessary. 
			<p>Therianthropy can be hereditary or acquired. In contrast to the hereditary type, which is decided by lineage, acquired therianthropy occurs by being cursed or enchanted or having a magic spell cast upon them. 
			<p>Numerous hereditary therianthropes assume a completely animal form when they change, but acquired ones often retain their human shape as an animal. (*2) 
			<p>Also, the conditions that cause the transformation vary, but the major ones include looking at a full moon, drinking wine, becoming genuinely angry and being doused with water. (*3) 
			<hr>
			<p>1: Some mature late in life and have protracted life spans. 
			<p>2: Save for having horns, fangs, and/or tails. 
			<p>3: The resulting animals are often dogs, wolves, cats, pandas or piglets. 
				<div style="text-align: center">
					<b>
					  <p class="textTitles">Potential Harm</p>
					</b>
				  </div>
			<p>Damage is basically on the low side. 
			<p>There are times when agitated therianthropes lay waste to a village, but by large, most therianthropes coexist peaceably with humans, helping with tasks involving manual labor or using their abilities to drive away youkai. 
			<p>Befriending them, even as humans, has many advantages, so they are popular youkai. 
			<p>However, some people may experience sinus inflammation from their animal hair. 
				<div style="text-align: center">
					<b>
					  <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
					</b>
				  </div>

			<p>Do not show surprise or fear if a neighbor suddenly turns into an animal. 
			<p>If one shows more fear than necessary, even a therianthrope will become agitated, putting one in danger. 
			<p>At such times, stay calm and attempt to engage in natural conversation, such as "My, your fur looks even better than usual today," or "Say, who did your magnificent horns? Not THE Jinbei Echigoya?" (*4) 
			<p>There is absolutely no disadvantage to being friendly with a therianthrope. 
			<p>If you suffer from sinus inflammation, tea is moderately effective, so drink it daily. 
			<hr>
			<p>4: Whatever is appropriate for the situation.
