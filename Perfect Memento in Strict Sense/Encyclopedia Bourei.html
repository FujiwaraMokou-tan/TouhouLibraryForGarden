            The souls of the dead who don't realize that they have died or whose
            unwillingness to recognize death is too strong will be unable to
            achieve nirvana, becoming bourei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bourei are different from yuurei, since they keep the appearance
            they did while alive, can touch and speak, and can't be told apart
            from a normal human by a casual observer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their body temperature isn't low, and the only living things that
            can become bourei are humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a large number of bourei are unable to traverse the river, they
            remain in the realms of the living, or cross over to the Netherworld
            or to Hell.
          </p>
          <p>In any case, there is absolutely no chance of reincarnation.</p>
          <p>
            If you become a bourei one day, until you accomplish your objective
            or your body ceremoniously buried, you won't achieve nirvana (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Bourei can easily influence the human heart with just their voices,
            so it is dangerous to carelessly talk to one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bourei who carry grudges are a particularly dangerous threat, so you
            should somehow find the body (*2) and have the burial ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, a bourei's weak point is its body (*3).</p>
          <p>Bourei hide their corpses and never reveal them to people.</p>
          <p>
            They don't have bodies of flesh, but they aren't as insubstantial as
            yuurei, so they can touch things.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, they find it difficult to pass through objects
            (*4).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, since they don't have physical bodies, even if they touch
            you, they can't harm you.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <i>*1: If they haven't realized that they're dead, they sometimes vanish
            upon finding their bodies.</i>
          </p>
          <p><i>*2: The corpse.</i></p>
          <p><i>*3: Since the corpse can't move.</i></p>
          <p><i>*4: Because many of them believe that they are still alive.</i></p>

              <p class="textTitles">Potential Harm</p>

          <p>
            The scariest thing is that they live alongside humans and can't be
            discerned as bourei by the untrained eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the bourei doesn't have any ill will, if you're touched by
            one of the dead, before you know it you'll be beckoned by death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, there are cases in which the bourei is a family member or
            friend, so people hesitate to hold a memorial ceremony and instead
            go on living together.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, it may seem like a happy thing to continue living together
            after someone dies, but the bourei is disconnected from the cycle of
            reincarnation, not only will they wander for eternity, but they'll
            soon realize that their entire family has died.
          </p>
          <p>Even more frightening are bourei who carry grudges.</p>
          <p>
            The take on the form of humans and deceive the living. Until the
            grudge is fulfilled they will haunt people to death.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're targeted by a bourei, the only way to ward it off is to
            ask a specialist to hold a memorial ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the truly scary thing about b?rei is that sometimes their
            victims accept them.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how familiar the face may be, if it's the face of a person
            who's supposed to be dead, you must harden your heart and request a
            memorial ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>Also, try not to create grudges.</p>
          <p>
            In particular, if you accidentally killed someone, you must quickly
            have a memorial ceremony and repent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though if you intentionally murdered someone, being haunted to death
            is reaping what you sow...
