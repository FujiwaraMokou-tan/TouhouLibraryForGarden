            It is said that the more tails a beast has, the more powerful it is,
            and the longer they are, the more clever it becomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The widely regarded authority among beasts is this nine-tailed fox
            youkai, Ran Yakumo (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            A fox with nine large tails, her prestigious pedigree displays her
            divinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who has enslaved this strongest of the beasts and uses her
            for various mundane tasks is the strongest youkai, Yukari Yakumo
            (*2).
          </p>
          <p>Ran is Yukari's shikigami.</p>
          <p>
            As a shikigami, Ran must do whatever Yukari commands, but she is
            also capable of using shikigami of her own.
          </p>
          <p>Ran's shikigami is Chen.</p>
          <p>However, Chen is too unreliable for Ran to depend upon.</p>
          <p>
            Ran is incredibly intelligent, and especially good at mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that she is capable of doing complex calculations far
            above anything a human can attempt in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, her forte is the analysis of existing phenomena, rather
            than that of new concepts (*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            She lives in the same house as Yukari Yakumo, and appears in
            Gensokyo in her place.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: This name is one given by her master, Yukari. Her real name is
              unknown.
            </p>
            <p>*2: Therefore, they're an unbeatable pair.</p></i
          >
          <p>
            *3: Shikigami on the outside world are called computers, and are said
            to be used for similar purposes.

            "That fox came here a while ago to buy some fried tofu. She properly
            paid for it and everything, even though she's an animal." (Tofu shop
            owner)
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you reach a certain level of intelligence, you feel ashamed at
            acts such as theft.
          </p>
          <p>This is true for both humans and youkai.</p>
          <p>
            "Lately, a nine-tailed fox has been wandering around the edge of the
            village like it's been sizing up something. I wonder what the youkai
            are planning; it's scary." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>There's no need for concern.</p>
          <p>
            This fox is merely making sure no untoward changes occur in
            Gensokyo, that the border experiences no degradation and performing
            other such checks.
          </p>
          <p>
            These duties were originally performed by Yukari Yakumo, but it
            seems that Yukari grew tired of them and Ran now performs them in
            her stead.
          </p>
          <p>"Her tails look so warm." (Reimu Hakurei)</p>
          <p>Of course they're warm.</p>
          <p>She's the strongest beast, after all.</p>

              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>She's intelligent, powerful and very fast.</p>
          <p>
            You should not challenge her unless you are extremely confident in
            your skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, she has a gentle personality and she takes no pleasure
            in self-aggrandizing combat, so one is unlikely to be attacked
            beyond reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, you must be prepared to do battle if you disrupt her work.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has no particular weaknesses, but she is extremely fond of fried
            tofu, so you may be able to avoid combat by offering her some.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably wise to carry fried tofu with you as a good-luck charm
            when walking animal trails.
          </p>
          <p>
            She appears in the human village from time to time, but there's no
            need to fear her then.
          </p>
          <p>She has only come to shop.</p>
