              <p class="textTitles">Characteristics</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>They are the very spirits of animals or plants.</p>
          <p>
            Able to convert what they see, hear, touch or taste into thoughts,
            it can be said that they're like sense converters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having no physical body nor specific form, they're similar to air.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can pass through any obstacle, and they can change their shape
            at will.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're often confused with bourei, which are always the embodiments
            of deceased, but yuurei are not necessarily always the spirits of
            the deceased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some are even born as yuurei, and remain so until they dissipate
            into nothing.
          </p>
          <p>Also unlike bourei, a single corpse may spawn several yuurei.</p>
          <p>
            Their characteristics are closer to those of fairies; like how
            fairies are the embodiment of nature, yuurei are the embodiment of
            spirits.
          </p>
          <p>They can live (*1) anywhere in Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            Yuurei that prefer noisy places gather in noisy places, ones that
            prefer gloomy places gather in gloomy places, and there are even
            those that prefer hot springs.
          </p>
          <p>They are usually active at night.</p>
          <p>
            It's assumed that because many of them have their existences on the
            verge of dissipating, it makes it difficult for them to act under
            sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>Also, their body temperature is very low (*2).</p>
          <p>Improper handling may even result in frostbite.</p>
          <p>
            However, this chill can be utilized for one's benefit; for example,
            during tests of courage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passing through a place, as a test of courage, where many yuurei
            seem likely to gather is a good way to feel a chill on a hot summer
            night (*3).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>*1: If it can be said they are "living."</p>
            <p>*2: Their hearts tend to be cold.</p>
            <p>*3: Thus yuurei are despised in winter.</p></i

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Potential Harm</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The most threatening feature a yuurei possesses is the ability to
            affect the minds of people around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one is surrounded by cheerful yuurei, they'll eventually feel
            pleasant.
          </p>
          <p>For gloomy yuurei, vice versa.</p>
          <p>
            For example, the places famous for suicides are often the places
            inhabited by gloomy yuurei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those without enough mental fortuity might even lose their mind, if
            they happen to face a powerful yuurei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, due to their low temperature, sustained contact may cause
            frostbite.
          </p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Avoiding encounters with yuurei is next to impossible, so all you
            can do attempt to remain unaffected upon contact.
          </p>
          <p>Generally, yuurei have transient and fragile existences.</p>
          <p>
            Even average humans should be fine if there are only a few of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's a different story if that person is mentally weakened
            (*4).
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping confidence in yourself and having no fear is the only way to
            deal with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it would be a wise idea not to, out of curiosity, go to
            places where yuurei gather (*5).
          </p>
          <p>It may result in your mind being shattered.</p>
          <p>
            If that happens, there's no other way but to seek an exorcism from a
            professional (*6).
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, there's currently research about the possibility
            of correcting one's personality by means of deliberate yuurei
            possession.
          </p>
          <p>
            This technique is expected to dissuade someone from committing
            suicide or helping someone overcome their dislike of vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's almost ready to be put into practical use, once a method of
            capturing yuurei is established.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not far-fetched to say that the future of human mentality rests
            on yuurei shoulders.
          </p>
