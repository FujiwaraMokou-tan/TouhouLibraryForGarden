            Heading further along the Road of Reconsideration, one would reach
            Muenzuka, where the road ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it's a small area enclosed by trees, this is the most
            dangerous place for both the humans and youkai of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this place is a graveyard for those without relatives, many
            of those were from the outside world, but became lost and ended up
            here, and the growing inclination towards the outside world has
            begun to gradually loosen the magic barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, as it is something similar to a graveyard, and also easily
            connected to the Netherworld, it's a place where no one knows what
            might happen (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are lovely things called purple cherry blossoms
            trees. Although their numbers are small, nothing else in Gensokyo
            can match their simple beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the flowers of these cherry blossoms fall, the deceased of
            Muenzuka will be released from their hestitation, and will finally
            progress to the Road of Liminality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purple cherry blossoms purify the soil of Muenzuka, and once per
            year this severing of doubts and fears causes the flowers to
            blossom, and even for Gensokyo, this is a quite a peculiar youkai
            cherry tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those flower petals that drop by ones and twos create a sight
            reminiscent of something like Muenzuka itself weeping, an illusion
            that will beguile any viewer.
          </p>
          <p>
            This might be the most perfect place for flower viewing, or so one
            might think, but the sorrowful sights create such sadness that there
            is no one who is able to make merry while watching them.
          </p>

            *1: Originally, being able to cross the magic barrier was impossible,
            but the current situation is exactly what has come to pass. For this
            reason, maintaining one's presence here has become difficult.
