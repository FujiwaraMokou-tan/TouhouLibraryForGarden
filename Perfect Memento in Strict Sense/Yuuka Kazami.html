            She lives surrounded by flowers all year round, and if anyone
            disturbs her, be they youkai or human, she eliminates them with
            tremendous power no matter what.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's more like a manifestation of nature rather than a flower
            youkai, but unlike fairies, she is far more dangerous than any of
            the youkai introduced so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is usually active in places surrounded by flowers, and seems
            peaceful at first glance but is merciless towards other creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            She wears bright clothes, and her appearance is no different from a
            human.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to manipulate flowers is something to the extent being
            able to make flowers bloom, shift the face of sunflowers towards the
            sun, or make withered flowers bloom again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ability is more of an extra; she truly possesses extremely high
            youkai power and physical abilities. A youkai-like youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            She doesn't feel an atom of fear when fighting humans or youkai, and
            loves rubbing people the wrong way.
          </p>
          <p>As youkai live longer, they become less active.</p>
          <p>There are few that take the initiative to attack humans.</p>
          <p>
            It is said that recently this youkai hasn't moved from the hill of
            flowers much.
          </p>

          <p>
            Completely unrelated to her abilities, she uses her umbrella and
            scatters flower petals to perform graceful attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that her umbrella is a special parasol that can largely
            cut ultraviolet rays (*1) and block rain as well.
          </p>
          <p>It can even block danmaku.</p>
          <p>
            Rather than relying on youkai abilities or magic, she often performs
            overwhelming physical attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This class of youkai is not interested in the average human, and
            only pays attention to equally strong youkai or humans with special
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when ones with power clash, both sides are aware that they
            cannot come to a conclusion easily
          </p>
          <p>
            To counter this, rules will often be decided beforehand and a formal
            battle will take place.
          </p>
          <p>
            By fighting with these rules, even if one could continue after
            losing, they must admit their loss.
          </p>
          <p>Once that is done, the other side will not continue further.</p>
          <p>That is the wisdom of youkai who have lived long.</p>

            "I see her at the shrine a lot. I wonder if that shrine maiden will

          <p>The shrine maiden there is infamous for not doing her job.</p>
          <p>
            However, it's said that she's exterminated this youkai several times

          <p>
            There are no countermeasures; it's impossible for ordinary humans to
            exterminate her. They can only be vigilant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, she isn't interested in boring battles, so as long as you
            don't attack, set up a trap, or set her field of flowers on fire,
            you should be fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you come across this youkai battling with someone else, do not
            get yourself involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these fights are based on certain rules, so as long as you
            do not disturb the fight, she'll be polite.
          </p>
          <p>If you can keep your distance, it's also a good idea to watch.</p>
          <p>Battles between non-humans are full of breathtaking beauty.</p>
