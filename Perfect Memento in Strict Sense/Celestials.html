          <p>Humans that live in Heaven.</p>
          <p>
            They live forever in Heaven, separated from the world of daily
            cares, and even from the circle of transmigration.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they are bright and carefree, and love song, dance and fishing,
            they spend their days on activities such as listening to music,
            fishing and playing go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Celestials are hermits who have long pursued ascetic knowledge, but
            they can be divided into those who have achieved immortality and
            ascended to heaven (*1), and those who have attained enlightenment
            and entered Nirvana after death.
          </p>
          <p>
            The former have physical bodies, so they can appear on earth with
            ease, but the latter cannot descend from Heaven without borrowing
            somebody's body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes they descend to earth, say absurd things that confound
            normal humans, and return to Heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            A celestial's body is like poison to youkai, and as a result, youkai
            almost never attack celestials, so they have nothing to fear on
            earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the most ferocious of beasts would be tamed if they only held
            out their hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are also able to ride on clouds, and the divine appearance this
            gives them is almost frightening.
          </p>
          <i>
          <p>

            thousands, of years.</i>

            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Celestials spend their days listening to music, fishing, and playing
            go, never bothered with the need to do work, and always able to eat
            the highest quality food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certainly, no small number of people would like to live their
            dream-like lifestyle (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, to become a celestial, humans must free themselves of
            worldly desires.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, the first requirement is certainly to not be the
            sort of person who would yearn for such a life.
          </p>
          <p>Likely, most people would not meet this requirement.</p>

              <p class="textTitles">The World of the Celestials</p>
            </b>
          </div>

            The celestial world is said to exist above the clouds, but in
            reality this is not the case.
          </p>
          <p>It actually exists far above the Netherworld.</p>
          <p>
            The dead are naturally able to go there, but it's also possible for
            living people to visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is because throwing away all desires includes freeing oneself
            of the desire to live, in which case one essentially becomes a
            living dead.
