            One who has become possessed by magic, such that the one's body
            itself is powered by magic; this type of youkai is known as a
            magician.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their livelihood revolves around magical research, spending their
            days thinking about new spells.
          </p>
          <p>Among youkai, they are the most similar to humans.</p>
          <p>
            There are two types of magicians: those who were born as magicians
            and humans who became magicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the point when they completely become magicians, their growth
            (aging) stops (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who were born as magicians, from the start, are only able to
            use magic, and just like humans, they grow, age, and have a limited
            lifespan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, when they learn "abandon temper" magic (*2), they become
            long-lived, complete magicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of those who were originally human, in continuing their
            study of magic, it is when they learn "abandon food" magic (*3) that
            they become magicians.
          </p>
          <p>After that, it's the same as for normal magicians.</p>
          <p>
            In any case, becoming a member of the magician race takes quite a
            bit of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since they continue to grow old like humans up until that point, in
            general there are many aged wizards and witches.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Gensokyo, magical research is more advanced and learning
            magic is simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, there are more than a few young (childish) magicians in
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's no way to tell them apart from humans by their appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their bodies are nearly the same as humans', so they are frail in
            comparison to other youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're generally intelligent, studious people with a lot of
            knowledge, but they tend to be hikikomori and not leave their homes.
          </p>
          <i>
          <p>
            1: There are those who repeatedly cast magic to restore their youth,
            but...
          </p>
          <p>2: Magic to stop one's growth. It can only be used on oneself.</p>
          <p>
            3: Magic that allows you to compensate for not eating food via magic
            power. It can only be used on oneself.

              <p class="textTitles">Potential Harm (Sacrifice, Theft, Abduction, Fraud)</p>
            </b>
          </div>
          <p>The most likely cause of harm is theft of livestock.</p>
          <p>
            Living livestock is necessary for large-scale magic, and it seems
            there is a serious livestock shortage among magicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, they often steal food and drink (especially liquor),
            and curios such as moon rocks.
          </p>
          <p>At worst, they might even steal children (*4).</p>
          <p>
            Also, they can use magic which is similar to sleight of hand and
            commit fraud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps performing magic requires money, but they will take any
            means necessary to raise funds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be particularly cautious if you see someone selling shady magic
            props on the roadside.

            </b>

          <p>The most important thing is to not trust magicians.</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, their bodies are only about as strong as that of an
            ordinary human, so running away is simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            A magician who is properly prepared is so strong that they can take
            on any kind of youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, they are weak to surprise attacks, and are not good at
            close combat or lengthy conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most fundamental thing is to be careful not to fall into a
            magician's trap, which will not happen without entering their
            territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you happen to do so, your best options are either to immediately
            run away or to boldly approach them.
