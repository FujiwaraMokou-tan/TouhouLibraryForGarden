          <p>
            Among the dead, those who are revered as gods are called divine
            spirits. There are those who lived as gods, and also those who,
            after death, ascended to godhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having no connection to the 8 million gods, these will not die even
            after a memorial service, but will simply extinguish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divine spirits, not possessing a body, usually live in a Shinto
            shrine or in a smaller shrine, and only during festivals will emerge
            to ride and have a good time on a portable Shinto shrine, seeing
            humans in this state will put them at ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The powers of the divine spirits come from the power of faith. If
            they have many believers, they will have a greater influence on
            humans and youkai, and the shrine will also become greater. (*1)
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, when faith decreases, their powers of influence will
            become weaker, and their shrine will begin to decline.
          </p>
          <p>Basically this is relying on the actions of others.</p>

          <p><i>*1: Because the monetary offerings will increase.</i></p>

          <p>
            There is a considerable lack of spirits in a shrine, so revealing
            their forms to people is something that mostly never happens.
          </p>
          <p>They speak so faintly that ordinary humans can't hear them.</p>
          <p>
            For this reason, those who carry the duty of facilitating
            communication are shrine maidens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shrine maidens can, utilizing peculiar methods (*2), hear the words
            of the divine spirits and communicate this to the people.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*2: Such as dancing, drinking alcohol, dancing while drinking
              alcohol and various other methods.</i

          <p>Shrines are not constructed by divine spirits, but by humans.</p>
          <p>
            If the shrine is built for an existing diving spirit, then that
            spirit will naturally take lodging in it.
          </p>
          <p>However, from here on in, there is a problem.</p>
          <p>
            Simply because it is a place for divine spirits, a shrine looks no
            different from any ordinary building.
          </p>
          <p>
            If many people come to the shrine to worship the divine spirit, it
            will begin to gain power from being worshipped by so many for the
            first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the number of visiting worshippers increases, expansions and
            renovations to to the shrine become an important matter, and a great
            amount of money will become necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, the goal of a shrine is to expend all acquired
            monetary offerings from the visiting worshippers.
