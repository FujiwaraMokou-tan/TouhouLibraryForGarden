          <p>The true identity of natural phenomena themselves.</p>
          <p>
            Fairies live in such phenomena where it gets cold and hot, rain
            falls and wind blows, grass grows and flowers bloom.
          </p>
          <p>
            They come in various shapes, but many of them are humanoid with
            wings like those of insects like butterflies and dragonflies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their height is uniformly small, from the degree where they can fit
            in the palm of one's hand, up to the size of a child below ten years
            of age. There is hardly any fairy outside of this scope.
          </p>
          <p>They live wherever there is nature.</p>
          <p>You can confirm their existence anywhere in Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            They especially prefer active places, so when humans and youkai
            gather you can probably spot lots of them.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, in gloomy places their numbers decrease.</p>
          <p>
            They are a kind of youkai you frequently can see even in human
            villages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies are active at all hours, so you can probably encounter them
            both at daytime and in the night.
          </p>
          <p>They don't seem to follow any manner of law or code.</p>
          <p>
            Also, an individual fairy is short-lived(*1), but they immediately
            resurrect in the same shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if they suffer large injuries so that their bodies are in
            pieces, they heal immediately.
          </p>
          <p>In a stricter sense, fairies can't die.</p>
          <p>Therefore they take reckless action, without fearing death.</p>
          <p>
            Since their concept of death appears to differ from that of humans,
            it is also said that they are simply foolish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies don't actually need to eat, but they see the way humans
            enjoy their meals and copy them, eating the same things.
          </p>
          <p>They eat anything which humans do.</p>
          <p>
            They especially like to sneak away that which humans are planning to
            eat.
          </p>

            <i>*1: Fairies lives differs from that of humans, so it is a mistake
            to say that they are short-lived.</i>

          <p>Pranks on a Whim.</p>
          <p>They all like pranks.</p>
          <p>
            If they catch sight of a human walking somewhere, they make them
            lose their way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're cleaning, they'll raise the wind to send all your
            gathered dust flying.
          </p>
          <p>When you are not looking, they put salt in your tea.</p>
          <p>
            Without thinking of the consequences, they disturb the actions of
            whomever they see.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also occasionally pranks that go too far, such as when you
            get pushed off a cliff, or when your back is set on fire, so it is
            necessary to be cautious.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you walk down the road while thinking about something else, you
            lose your way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're absorbed in conversation with a friend, your bags are
            carried away when you're not looking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things like these are sometimes thought to be caused by fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people that most easily get pulled into pranks are those that
            are uncautious and prone to being preoccupied with other things.
          </p>
          <p>Fairies won't go near cautious people.</p>
          <p>
            Therefore, if you usually pay attention to your surroundings, you
            should be fine.
          </p>
          <p>But if you were to be subjected to a prank, what should you do?</p>
          <p>
            The truth is that while fairies are reckless, they don't like
            fighting much at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a human notices the prank, the fairies will probably run away
            as fast as they can.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were to be successful in catching one, you can freely vent
            your anger on it since they're not very strong.
          </p>
          <p>A grown human should win easily.</p>
          <p>
            However, there are also the occasional exceptions where without
            doing any pranks, they just suddenly attack.
          </p>
          <p>At such times you must be careful.</p>
          <p>
            That is because there is a possibility that it is a warning for
            something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially when fairies aggregate in large numbers or start
            clamoring, there is a possibility that there is an unbelievably
            powerful youkai lurking about nearby(*2). Therefore, you must be
            careful.
          </p>
          <p>
            At such times, I think it's best if you just quietly head back home.
