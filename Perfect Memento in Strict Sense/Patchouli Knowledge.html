            Patchouli Knowledge is a magician known as the brains of the Scarlet
            Devil Mansion, the manor where devils live.
          </p>
          <p>It is her role to resolve problems that occur there (*1).</p>
          <p>
            She has long hair, but otherwise her appearance is indistinguishable
            from a human's.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is purely a magician, and it is said she has lived for over a
            hundred years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Astonishingly, it is also said she has spent most of those hundred
            years reading books.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is proficient in various types of magic and eagerly researches
            new spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever she devises a new spell, she inscribes it into a magic
            book, expanding the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's unknown when exactly she settled into the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion, but judging by the size of the library, it must have been a
            considerable time ago.
          </p>

            She is a magician's magician, able to cast various sorts of magic.
          </p>
          <p>She mainly uses elemental magic.</p>
          <p>
            Elemental magic borrows on the power of fairies and spirits to
            result in an output greatly exceeding the small input.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elemental magic is comprised of seven varieties: "wood," for life
            and awakening; "fire," for change and movement; "earth," for
            foundation and immobility; "metal," for wealth and abundance;
            "water," for silence and purification; "sun," for activity and
            offense; "moon," for passivity and defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            While being able to use magic from all these elements, the
            surprising part is that it seems she is able to cast spells that
            combine two or more elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, her variations are extraordinarily abundant. She can
            combine fire and wood to increase her power, or combine fire and
            earth to cover her weaknesses, and much more.

          <p>
            Grimoires, or magic books, are not simply books, but are magical
            items with magic power sealed inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their contents are not simply directions on how to cast magic, but
            the secret keys to the use of magic itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In theory, anyone could cast a spell if they had the appropriate
            magic book, but without finding the key inside, it would not be
            possible to understand what is written within.
          </p>
          <p>
            One cannot find the key if they do not possess equal or greater
            skill than the person who wrote the grimoire.
          </p>
          <p>
            The letters written in the book are not the system used by humans,
            but are said to be divine-era hiragana, or perhaps the original
            Japanese writing system.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a great library beneath the Scarlet Devil Mansion filled
            with veritable mountains of magic books.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many magic books that she has written, as well as many
            that no one has been able to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            The library holds a great many books besides magic books, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of this material consists of books from the outside world (*2).

          <i>
            <p>
              *2: Gensokyo's books are primarily handwritten. There are few

            Since Japan is quite humid, archives are typically built in
            well-ventilated areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Scarlet Devil Mansion is a Western-style building, it may
            not have been made with Japanese climates in mind.

            One can read a book from the outside world just like any other book.

            The characteristic of elemental magic is to create great effects
            from a small amount of power, but there are flaws to this approach.
          </p>
          <p>That is because each element has its own weak point.</p>
          <p>This applies to her magic as well.</p>
          <p>
            If by some chance you end up in a battle with her, you must stay
            alert to which element of magic she is using while fighting her.
          </p>
          <p>
            But since she seldom leaves the Scarlet Devil Mansion, battles with
            her are extremely rare.
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as you do not break into it, there will be no chance of
            fighting her.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, her physical condition is poorer than that of a
            human's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since she is asthmatic (*3), she can't exert herself too much, lest
            it becomes difficult to breathe.
          </p>
          <p>This places her in an unusual category among youkai.</p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *3: As is characteristic for a magician, she can speak extremely
              quickly in a low voice. It's suffocating to watch her speak so
              quickly even with asthma.
