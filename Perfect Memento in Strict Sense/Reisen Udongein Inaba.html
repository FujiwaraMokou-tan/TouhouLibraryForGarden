            Reisen Udongein Inaba, the youkai rabbit whose dissimilitude with
            other beasts makes her all the more unusual.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to most beasts' feral nature, she has an upright
            posture.
          </p>
          <p>Her movement is rather slow for a beast as well.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, she does not attack humans.</p>
          <p>In fact, she tends to avoid them.</p>
          <p>She has extremely long ears and hair.</p>
          <p>
            She is certainly one-of-a-kind among the youkai rabbits in all
            respects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tewi Inaba acts as leader of the rabbits, but she gives orders to
            Tewi (*1).
          </p>
          <p>This makes her the de facto leader of the rabbits.</p>
          <p>It's said you'll go mad if you look directly into her red eyes.</p>
          <p>
            In addition, her voice is said to have unusual effects as well. For
            example, you may be unable to perceive what she's saying even if you
            hear her perfectly, or you may hear her as if she were whispering
            into your ears, even though she's far away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to phenomena such as these, it's hard to have a true, direct
            conversation with her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She can usually be found where she lives, at Eientei in the Bamboo
            Forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond that, her routine is unknown, but occasionally she can be
            seen in the human village selling medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's well known for walking about with a large supply of dubious
            drugs (*2).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: An as-yet unfounded rumor is that she seems to listen to
              little of what she says.
            </p>
            <p>*2: Such as being frighteningly bitter.</p></i

          <p>
            The ability to manipulate insanity is essentially the power to make
            you go mad, specifically, the power to control the waves that reside
            in all things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasing the wavelengths, that is, making the subject carefree,
            results in an apathetic lethargy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decreasing the wavelengths, that is, bringing madness to the
            subject, results in emotional instability, and leaves the subject
            unable to converse with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasing the amplitude results in an excess of existence, which
            allows her to transmit thoughts no matter how far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decreasing the amplitude results in a rarefaction of existence, in
            which case one's voice will never reach another, no matter how close
            they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Synchronizing the waves' phases causes interference to vanish, which
            makes it impossible to touch anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Offsetting the phases negates existence, and completely hides the
            subject's form.
          </p>
          <p>By using various effects such as these, she can induce madness.</p>

            "It was early in the morning, and I'd gone to cut bamboo in the
            forest.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, it felt as if all the bamboo was lookin' down on me.</p>
          <p>My hips started achin', then the rest of my body, too.</p>
          <p>Then, I saw a strange youkai rabbit.</p>
          <p>She was lookin' at the sky and mutterin' under her breath.</p>
          <p>
            It looked like she was talkin' to someone, but there was nothin'
            there but the fallin' moon ...
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to leave because it was gettin' creepy, but then she
            turned around and realized I was there.
          </p>
          <p>And all of a sudden, she completely vanished.</p>
          <p>I wonder if it was just a dream..." (The Old Woodcutter)</p>
          <p>Maybe it was, perhaps (*3).</p>
          <p>
            As this youkai rabbit acts in such a mysterious fashion, there is so
            much that is unknown about her.
          </p>
          <i> <p>*3: Or perhaps it was an old man being... that.</p></i>

          <p>There are no reports of this youkai attacking humans.</p>
          <p>
            However, she can't exactly be considered friendly, either. For
            example, whenever she comes to the human village to sell medicines,
            she disappears back into the forest as soon as her work has ended.
          </p>
          <p>She seems to prefer the same sorts of foods that humans eat.</p>
          <p>Even in this fashion she differs from most youkai.</p>
          <p>
            However, one must make certain not to look directly into her red
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>Just like the full moon, they have a strange effect on humans.</p>
