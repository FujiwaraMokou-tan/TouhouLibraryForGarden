          <p>There is a youkai that has only been seen during winter.</p>
          <p>
            A youkai that prefers cold places, Letty Whiterock is feared for
            ensnaring humans and freezing them, rendering them powerless to
            fight back.
          </p>
          <p>To keep it simple, she is a type of Yuki-onna.</p>
          <p>
            This youkai appears as a woman wearing light clothing that doesn't
            seem like it would protect her from the cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            She appears during unusually cold days, though it is unknown whether
            the coldness is due to her appearance instead.
          </p>
          <p>The extreme coldness might make you lose any will to fight(*1).</p>
          <p>
            If caught by her tricks, it isn't an exaggeration to say that the
            fight is over before it even began.
          </p>
          <p>
            It does not mean that she directly makes the wind blow and snow
            fall, but since she can enhance the winter that exists within
            nature, she can exhibit ridiculous powers which seem impossible for
            one youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being controlled by nature, her power is extremely strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            After causing a thorough riot during winter, she suddenly disappears
            when spring comes.
          </p>
          <p>It seems she hides somewhere until the next winter.</p>

          <p>"I only see her on cold days." (Anonymous)</p>
          <p>
            Probably because of such reasons, this youkai does not leave a good
            impression.
          </p>
          <p>
            "When there is a snowstorm outside, I can't go outside because I'm
            afraid she might appear. However, my house is safe because it has
            good heating." (Owner of Kourindou)
          </p>
          <p>
            I would advise that people go out only on clear days during winter,
            if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you shut yourself up in your house for a long time, the
            snow piled up on the roof will cause your house to collapse, so
            beware.

            The thing called cold air is very troublesome. It is not a
            physically thrown cold object (*2), but something that lowers the
            temperature of the whole area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even healthy people can become sick. Even active people become
            inactive. They lose their fighting spirit.
          </p>
          <p>There may be no way to completely avoid it.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, wear warm clothes.</p>
          <p>This is the most important thing.</p>
          <p>It is enough if your body can move while you flee.</p>
          <p>
            In particular, if the extremities of your body become cold, your
            circulation might worsen, so you should take care to eat well.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are careless and happen to see her while wearing light
            clothes, it is hopelessly difficult to escape, because the coldness
            extends for a wide range.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not resistant to the cold, it is unlikely you will
            survive for long.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even though this youkai is fearsome, she only appears
            during winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            When spring comes and it becomes warmer, there is nothing to fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find this youkai during summer, it might be your best chance
            to strike (*3).
