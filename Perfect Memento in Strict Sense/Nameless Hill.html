            Opposite of Youkai Mountain is a small mountain, and halfway up it
            is a meadow with a great number of lilies-of-the-valley.
          </p>
          <p>Somehow, it is in a place hidden from the human village.</p>
          <p>
            It doesn't get much direct sunlight and it's fairly windy, so it
            doesn't get very warm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason this place is called Nameless Hill is because long ago it
            was a place where children were abandoned (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Young children who weren't even given names were brought here to
            sleep to their death among the lilies' poison.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dead bodies were cleaned up by the youkai, so they disappeared
            without a trace.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's said that some of the children were abducted by
            mischievous youkai and raised as youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are sad stories of parents not wanting to see their own
            children die, so they would leave them here thinking they might have
            a chance to live as youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps because of its dark history, not many humans visit this
            place today.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point youkai stopped visiting as well, so this is a place
            forgotten by contemporary Gensokyo, having become "nameless" just as
            the term implies (*2).
          </p>
          <i>
          <p>
            *1: This is a story from when one could pass between Gensokyo and the
            outside world. Of course, this doesn't take place today.
          </p>
          <p>*2: Ah, how clever!</p></i>
