          <p>Ah, hello, it's ZUN as usual.</p>
          <p>
            Thank you very much for reading Perfect Memento in Strict Sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though this compendium of information was set in Gensokyo in
            name only, its contents cannot be enjoyed if one doesn't have a
            considerable knowledge of Touhou, but this is usually how it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite that, take away the Gensokyo Chronicles from Perfect Memento
            in Strict Sense and only the front cover and this afterword remains.
            Saying this is... you know.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Now then, this time tales and stories were excluded as much as
            possible, and an objective rather than subjective point of view was
            the goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, those who have the most realistic perspectives on
            things are, as expected, the humans of Gensokyo, with their optimal
            levels of judgment and reasoning. For that reason, instead of
            myself, I had Akyuu come forth.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I've said it so many times now, Gensokyo is idyllic and pastoral,
            and is a "peace-addled" kind of a world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, if lives become endangered by something, in most
            situations, there will be an arranged battle involving humans and
            youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            If danmaku were thought of as an abstraction of such battles, it is
            possible to understand why there are a pointless number of attacks,
            and when thinking about the games, new ideas come easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would no longer be necessary to force additions to the
            characteristics of the games, and they would become much more fun to
            play.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Despite being a compendium on the games, this book does not touch on
            the games at all. This is because I want the things relating to the
            games to complete themselves within the games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically speaking, things like the contents of this book itself,
            even if you play the games, are still nothing but utterly
            unnecessary content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this was originally a shooting game, to say this is a work
            based on the worlds that important people of the past created is
            rather haughty...
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Well then, with regards to the meaning of the information within
            this book, I made it so that others could enjoy Touhou in addition
            to the games.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not miscellany, nor completed or conclusive with itself, but
            just a strange and mysterious book, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, thank you to the illustrators -- Asai, Monoji Tsukuri,
            Aki&#9734;Eda, TOKIAME, Yagi Shinba and Yamai -- and Ichijinsha, who
            published this odd book.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            So next time, when considering why or how Akyuu is the 9th
            generation, I think maybe the monologue could instead be replaced by
            something interesting and amusing but...
          </p>
          <p>Well, that's a different story.</p>
