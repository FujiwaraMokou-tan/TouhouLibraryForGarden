            Even though Yamas are not youkai who reside in Gensokyo, they do
            appear in Gensokyo on rare occasions, so they will be given an
            introduction here.

          <p>
            In times past, when there were comparatively fewer humans, the cycle
            of spiritual transmigration operated with great reliability. The
            policy of crossing over seven times (plus 3 additional times)(*1)
            was carried out by the Ten Kings (*2). If the first judgement was
            succesful, then the cycles of spiritual transmigration would be as
            gratifying as the sweetest of desserts.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the number of humans increased little by little, and the
            number of judges proved unable to keep up, at which point the Ten
            Kings called upon the most powerful of Yamas of the day to reduce
            the number of pending trials as much as possible. And thus the
            shortage in personnel was resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, Jizou (the bodhisvattas for children, travellers, and
            the underworld) from all over the country who were interested in
            serving as Yamas gathered, and the deceased who had died in
            proximity to a Jizou were entrusted with being judges.
          </p>
          <p>Nearly all Yama are formerly old Jizou.</p>
          <p>
            In present times, to address the issue of humans outnumbering
            judges, they formed "The Ministry of Right and Wrong" along with the
            shinigami and oni in Hell to take up the business of operations and
            oversight.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: The number was originally seven times, but all of these "seven
              times" cases had problems, and so three additional judgements were
              implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
              *2: King Shinkou the Immovable, King Shoukou the Enlightened One,
              King Soutei the Wisest, King Fukan of Virtuous Conduct, King Enma
              the Merciful Savior, King Henjyou of the Future, King Taizan of
              Medicine and Healing, King Byoudou of Mercy and Compassion, King
              Toshi of Strength and Wisdom, and King Gotoutenrin of Limitless
              Light and Life make up the Ten Kings.

          <p>At the top of this organization, there presides 10 Yamas.(*3)</p>
          <p>
            Below them are lesser judges and oni lords. Each and every judge
            also commands several shinigami, while each of the oni lords
            similarly commands a number of lesser oni.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this place, all lower ranks including lesser judges may
            consult with the Yamas.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, for the spirits who have been brought by shinigami via Higan,
            they will be taken to the court of the lesser judge who has
            jurisdiction over where the spirit formerly lived.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each trial has is presided by a single judge, who will pass
            judgement without heeding the testimony of the deceased (*4), and
            thus divide the souls towards Heaven, Hell or the Netherworld as the
            outcome dictates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The oni lords will take charge as the souls fall down to Hell and
            will command the lesser oni in their torment of the deceased.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wide array of torture devices could be used, but current economic
            conditions mean that many of these contraptions are in serious need
            of maintenance and repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organization's primary sources of income are fares from those
            crossing the Sanzu River, as well as concession stands and food
            carts operating on the Road of Liminality.

            Misdeeds committed while still living will be read loudly and
            clearly, the details and the severity will be considered, and the
            verdict will then be announced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the verdict has been passed down, there is no chance of
            revoking or appealing the decision.

          <p>
            While this judgement will determine the final destination of the
            spirit, there are often lies (those who lie to the Yama have their
            tongues pulled out) spoken in the process, the Yama keeps an
            extensive archive at their side of past lies with which to threaten
            the deceased regarding risks and dangers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address the issue of an excess of deceased subjects, the judging
            proceeds in an assembly-line fashion, executed with extraordinary
            speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two alternating shifts unceasingly pass down judgements, but in
            their free time, they enjoy a leisurely life in Higan.
