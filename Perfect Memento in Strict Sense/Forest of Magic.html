            The most humid place in Gensokyo, this natural forest that humans
            rarely step foot into is the Forest of Magic (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            The distance from the human village is relatively short, but the
            forest's environment is extremely hazardous to humans, the spores of
            monster mushrooms dance about in midair and a normal human breathing
            the air in here would cause their physical condition to worsen.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as the typical youkai will find the place uncomfortable,
            another feature of the forest that even youkai refrain from
            entering.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, if one could stand the noxious gasses that the
            monstrous mushrooms emit, then on the contrary, it would be both a
            safe and secretive place to seclude oneself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The forest has areas of ground upon which the sun never shines,
            making them dark and damp.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, mushrooms grow endlessly there.</p>
          <p>
            There are mushrooms here that can be used for food for humans who
            can withstand them, but they don't look very appealing. And also,
            there are a relatively high number of mushrooms with hallucinogenic
            properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, there are a relatively high number of mushrooms with
            hallucinogenic properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason why it was called the Forest of Magic in the first place
            is because of the wide number of hallucinogenic mushrooms growing
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply being near them will make hallucinations appear as if
            entranced by magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            And also, for the sake of increasing their magical powers with these
            hallucinogenic mushrooms, there are many magicians who live in this
            forest.
          </p>

            1: Since Gensokyo is not that big, there is not much need to bother
            with place names. Usually if you mention a forest it's the Forest of
            Magic, if you talk about a village it's the human village, and if
            you talk about a mountain it refers to Youkai Mountain.
