          <p>On the eastern edge of Gensokyo lies its only shrine.</p>
          <p>
            This shrine exists on the border between the outside world and
            Gensokyo (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            All of Gensokyo can be seen from this shrine, and it is famous for
            having the most beautiful cherry blossom trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hakurei shrine maiden, who specializes in incident resolution,
            lives here.
          </p>
          <p>
            She watches over Gensokyo from here, and when an incident arises,
            she will go out immediately and ascertain the cause.
          </p>
          <p>It's said that she resolved the recent Scarlet Mist incident.</p>
          <p>
            Although normally youkai should not approach the shrine, there is a
            rumor that it has become a den of youkai, and that humans no longer
            approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as in the village, one is ensured safety from attacks by youkai
            while at the shrine; however, as the path between the shrine and the
            village is an animal trial with poor visibility, and since safety
            cannot be guaranteed, it has always prevented people from visiting
            the shrine to worship.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has other special traits, such as items from the outside world
            appearing within the proximity of the shrine or people from the
            outside world spotted nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            A human being from outside will become food shortly after
            encountering a youkai, but if his luck is sufficient to find the
            shrine, they can return to their own world (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the items from the outside world are mysterious, and are
            popular among humans and youkai alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, many collectors like to gather around the shrine.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is said that the purpose of most of the discovered
            objects is unknown.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            1: To be accurate, the place where this shrine exists is not
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            2: It is said that the human beings who don't want to return outside
            have increased in number lately. In that case, they are made to live
            in the human village.
