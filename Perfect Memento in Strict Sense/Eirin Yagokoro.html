          <p>
            She is a master pharmacist that prepares medicine at the Eientei,
            and sells it (*1) to both human and youkai.
          </p>
          <p>She has only recently started this business.</p>
          <p>
            Her medicines are divided into consigned and direct sale varieties.
            Consignment operates by distributing medicine boxes to each
            household, and at the turn of the season the usage is checked. Only
            the price of the consumed medicine is then charged.
          </p>
          <p>Those are medicines to heal light injuries, colds, etc.</p>
          <p>
            Direct sale medicines are purchased in-person at Eientei. There are
            ones such as short-lasting medicines, medicines for serious
            illnesses and medicines for special cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her medicines have a reputation of working efficiently and without
            side-effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is but a single warning. Medicines for youkai and for
            humans are very different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medicine for youkai are too strong for humans and they will suffer
            from side-effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, medicines for humans are poisonous to youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if you go to Eientei, she can examine you just as a doctor
            would.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that she can provide medicine even for unidentifiable
            diseases (*2).
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*1: For a fee. She doesn't make the deliveries herself, the
              youkai rabbits do.</i

          </p>
          <p>
            <i
              >*2: But then again, even if you go into the Bamboo Forest of the
              Lost, there is no guarantee that you'll reach Eientei.</i

          <p>She is not overly concerned with payment her services.</p>
          <p>
            Her medicines are not only very effective, but carry a fair price.
            And even if you can't pay immediately, she will wait however long it
            takes for the payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if if you suddenly fall ill while poor, she will kindly examine
            you.
          </p>
          <p>And this is for both human and youkai.</p>
          <p>
            The fact that she has appeared all of a sudden and started treating
            people's illnesses, and yet doesn't seem to be motivated by money,
            gives an impression that there's something else to her behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            She seems like a kind human at first impression, but since the
            reasons for her kindness are unknown, she sometimes makes people
            uneasy.
          </p>
          <p>She is a model person.</p>

            </b>

          <p>
            There are a lot of mysteries about Eientei, but she is the most
            mysterious part of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where did she gain her knowledge about medicine? Why can she make
            medicine for youkai as well? What was she doing before opening her
            pharmacy business? And many more yet unanswered questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her age is also unknown. Although she looks young at a first glance,
            her manner of speaking and behavior are characteristic of someone
            who has lived a long time, which only makes the question harder to
            ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            And especially strange is that, even though she possesses extensive
            knowledge, she is lacking of more general common sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ask her about this, she'll answer with an incoherent response
            like that her skin looks so smooth because she made a rejuvenating
            medicine (*3), and won't talk any more about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumor has it that she is a human with a deep connection to the Lunar
            Capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that there are a lot of events and people associated with
            the moon at Eientei, and that rabbits are the ones that distribute
            the medicine seem to give support to this rumor.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wouldn't be strange if her advanced medicinal practice was the
            moon's medicinal science itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a possibility that, through some way, she has obtained the
            technology from the Lunar Capital.
