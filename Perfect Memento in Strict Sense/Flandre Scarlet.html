          <p>There are two vampires in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
          <p>
            The older sister and the mansion's mistress, Remilia Scarlet, and
            her younger sister, Flandre Scarlet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flandre seldom leaves the Scarlet Devil Mansion (*1), but her
            existence has been confirmed by humans that enter it on occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has unusual seven-colored wings, and her hair is a light blond
            color, but her build and apparent age are similar to that of her
            older sister, Remilia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two wings on her back are of an irregular shape unlike those of
            any living creature, youkai or ghost.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has few friends even among the youkai of the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion, and spends most of her time in isolation.
          </p>
          <p>Even her older sister Remilia is seldom seen together with her.</p>
          <p>As a result, much about her is shrouded in mystery.</p>
          <p>
            It is said she possesses the ability to destroy anything at all even
            without touching them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything that is made for her to play with ends up broken, so she
            probably doesn't have many playmates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her method of destroying things so effortlessly involves pouring her
            power into the "eyes" of any material where its tension is the
            highest.
          </p>
          <p>
            She can use her ability to cause these "eyes" to move into the palm
            of her hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, by crushing the "eye" held within her hand (*2), she
            causes things to break.
          </p>
          <p>It's a truly frightening ability with no real weaknesses.</p>
          <i>
          <p>
            *1: Perhaps she's locked away, but it's also rumored she's a shut-in.
          </p>
          <p>*2: When she clenches her fist, the subject breaks.</p></i>

            "Sometimes when I sneak into the Scarlet Devil Mansion like I own
            it, I run into the little sister. I had to slip by without drawin'
            her attention, but after goin' through all that to get into the
            place, I was hopin' I wouldn't run into her." (Marisa Kirisame)
          </p>
          <p>What a terribly selfish report.</p>
          <p>"I doubt she can fly with those wings." (Reimu Hakurei)</p>
          <p>It is plausible she cannot (*3).</p>
          <p>
            "I saw her shadow wandering around the mansion while I was at an
            outdoor party at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. It was truly
            frightening. I knew it was her just from the silhouette, but she
            doesn't get to join many parties." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>Almost like something from a horror story.</p>

            Since it's unlikely anyone will ever see or meet her, there isn't
            anything of which to be aware, but all you need to remember is that
            there are two vampires that live in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if her older sister Remilia is away, you should remember that
            there's another vampire inside the mansion, and not sneak in
            unprepared.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many mysteries to her abilities, and such simple things as
            the range of her ability and how to defeat her are unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one thing that can be said is that it is an extremely dangerous
            ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, she also possesses the usual superhuman strength
            attributed to vampires, so it would surely be impossible to put up a
            fight against her.
