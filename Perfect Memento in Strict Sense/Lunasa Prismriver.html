            Technically speaking, poltergeists are not yuurei, but there are no
            other appropriate classifications for them so they are described
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Prismriver Ensemble is a so-called phantom ensemble(*1) that are
            often called to perform at events such as youkai parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're famous for playing vigorous songs with a strong rhythm, so
            they are the most well-known band in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ensemble is composed of three poltergeist sisters; Lunasa is the
            oldest of the three and excels at the violin.
          </p>
          <p>She appears to be the leader of the Prismriver Ensemble.</p>
          <p>Her height is around that of a teenaged human girl.</p>
          <p>Her appearance does not differ significantly from a human's.</p>
          <p>
            Her violin is said to be the yuurei of an instrument that would
            outclass even a Stradivarius(*2), but it's unknown whether this is
            true or not.
          </p>
          <p>In any case, it's a yuurei.</p>
          <p>
            Another word for poltergeists are noisy spirits(*3), as they are
            spirits which are able to make sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The noises that poltergeists make are actually the yuurei of notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since they're perceived by the spirit and not the ears, even beings
            without bodies can enjoy them.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, humans should be careful that its effect doesn't
            overwhelm them.
          </p>
          <p>She is a very collected person, but she is recitent and glum.</p>
          <p>The sounds she creates calm the spirit.</p>
          <p>
            People who are overly influenced by her sounds will lose all
            motivation and become depressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's said to live in a ruined Western mansion a bit farther from
            the lake than the Scarlet Devil Manor.
          </p>
          <p>You won't see the sisters there even if you set foot inside.</p>
          <p>
            However, it's said that you will hear the sounds of their
            practicing.
          </p>

          <p>
            1: This is not meant to mean that its members are always absent.
          </p>
          <p>2: They say this at the beginning of their live performances.</p>
          <p>
            3: This may not be true. Poltergeists are said to be one form of
            magic used by young maidens.

            You might have luck by going to the Ruined Western Mansion and

            (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>
            She isn't human, so something horrible might happen to you if you
            say things like that too often.

          <p>
            It should be noted that the Prismrivers do not manage ticket sales
            for their live performances. Their clients do, so it is inadvisable
            complaining to the Prismrivers if you can't acquire on a ticket.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their performances contain many notes that have a great effect on
            the spirit, so one should not attend unless one is in perfect mental
            condition.
          </p>
          <p>Children should not be allowed to listen.</p>
          <p>The notes of yuurei is a privilege for adults.</p>
