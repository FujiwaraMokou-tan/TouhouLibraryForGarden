            When it is spring, humans, youkai and ghosts suddenly become more
            active. In fact, there are few who do not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fairy who symbolizes this activity is the fairy who bears
            spring, Lily White.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lily White notices the trivial changes that normal humans don't
            notice, and tells all living things(*1) that have been in deep
            hibernation during the winter that the season of awakening has come.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the passing of this fairy, everything becomes wrapped in the
            joy of spring.
          </p>
          <p>Her height is quite low, and she has many thin wings(*2).</p>
          <p>
            She is not agressive, and even if you come across her, her threat
            level is low.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, disturbing her while she is conveying her message would not
            be wise.
          </p>
          <p>This is when this fairy is at her strongest.</p>
          <p>Like other fairies, where she lives is unknown.</p>
          <p>
            And she has rarely been seen during any season other than spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of that, Lily has become synonymous with the season of
            spring.

          <p>
            The Fairy Herald of Spring referred to in this poem is Lily White.
          </p>
          <p>
            She always appears from the west and disappears toward the
            mountain(*3), but there is no instance in which she has been seen
            going back the other way. Where in the world does she live?
            (Reported by many sources)
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the reason that she's never seen returning from the mountain
            is that, each year, she's eaten by the mountain youkai and stops
            announcing spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            My child caught her. Perhaps because she immediately said "Let me
            go!" and my child promptly let her go, there fortunately wasn't any
            damage. (Anonymous Parent)
          </p>
          <p>
            This fairy isn't the sort that would usually injure humans, but it's
            generally safer not to get involved with non-humans.

              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>If you don't do anything to her, there's no real danger.</p>
          <p>In fact, catching sight of her is a good omen.</p>
          <p>She simply wants to celebrate the fact that spring has come.</p>
          <p>
            If she happens to attack, it's possible that she's just excited, so
            the best course of action is to leave the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fairy won't be able to leave any place that is turning to
            spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you get away from her, there's no need to worry that she might
            chase after you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, it could be interesting to set out bait in order to tame
            her.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you prepare some flower seeds for her, she'll gladly make any
            nearby flowers bloom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, she's a fairy who's very popular with florists.
