            When looking at the stars covering the night sky, it may sometimes
            seem that one is surrounded by the eyes of countless beasts or
            youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there is a fairy with eyes that can survey as far as the light
            that falls down from the stars.
          </p>
          <p>That is the starlight fairy, Star Sapphire.</p>
          <p>
            She rarely attacks or disturbs humans, but she mostly causes trouble
            by helping with other fairies' (*1) pranks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her stature is quite short, and she possesses large, butterfly-like
            wings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this fairy is very attentive to movements, you will soon be found
            if you try to approach her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capturing her is extremely difficult, and she is rarely sighted
            alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, she is seen in the company of Sunny Milk and Luna Child.
          </p>

            "I caught this huge butterfly in the bird-warding nets." (Vegetable
            farmer)
          </p>
          <p>She probably can't notice things that don't move.</p>
          <p>
            Since she has butterfly wings, you could imagine her looking as if
            caught in a spider's web.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I saw the ice fairy and the light fairies having a fight.(*2) The
            blue one was just looking and laughing from below." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies are very self-centered, so they easily come into conflict
            with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, as the ice fairy is used to fighting, she would likely
            win by herself even against 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, Star Sapphire always keeps calm and avoids fighting so
            much it can be hard to tell on what side she is.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*2: When fairies start something, they can't think of anything
              else. If they start to fight, they won't pay any attention to
              their surroundings. So, if you find them in the middle of a fight,
              you can place bets on which one will win if you wish.</i

              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>

          <p>
            Even though she cannot do a great amount of direct damage, she
            basically acts with with other two fairies, so the same
            counter-measure mentioned for Sunny Milk can be employed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when she is on observation duty for the other fairies, she
            can be a threat.
          </p>
          <p>Because even if you try, you can't elude her ability.</p>
          <p>
            The best and most reliable counter-measure against it is to use a
            separate creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Star Sapphire's ability can't distinguish between a human and a
            similarly-sized animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you slip into a herd of animals and move along with them, she
            might not even notice you.
          </p>
          <p>In fact, this could be an interesting game as well.</p>
          <p>
            By using animals as decoys, you can lure out Star Sapphire and the
            others, and catch them at that time.
          </p>
          <p>In other words, this would be fairy-fishing(*3).</p>
