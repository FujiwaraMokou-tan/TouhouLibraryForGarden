            Close to the lake, there are times when the temperature lowers
            drastically even in summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            A fairy you are likely to encounter at such times is this ice fairy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the fairies around the lake she has a leader-like presence,
            and is stronger than the other fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            She belongs to the more belligerent variety of fairies, and so it is
            necessary to be careful.
          </p>
          <p>She is quite short and dressed in blue with wings of ice.</p>
          <p>She has the ability to manipulate the cold.</p>
          <p>
            Being able freeze small objects instantly, she is a bit more
            dangerous than regular fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            She emits cold air constantly, so her vicinity is always chilly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since where she lives is totally unknown, there is no way of telling
            how she spends her everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just Cirno's, but all fairies' homes blend into nature,
            preventing them from being seen by humans.

            "I saw her freezing a part of the Misty Lake's surface and sleeping
            defenselessly on the ice." (Hikozaemon)
          </p>
          <p>
            "I saw her sleeping sloppily next to the lake. The surrounding
            flowers were frozen." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are many other sightings near the Misty Lake as well, it
            is presumed that is where her home is located.
          </p>
          <p>It is possible that she has a house in underwater.</p>
          <p>
            "I saw frozen frogs in the rice fields. I think this is the work of
            fairies." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>An ominous prank. There's little direct harm, but still...</p>
          <p>
            "When I pulled in some fish from the Misty Lake, it was already
            frozen. That was a real surprise, but the fish kept a long time, and
            was delicious." (Angler with a big appetite)
          </p>
          <p>And here I thought that no humans fished at the Misty Lake...</p>
          <p>
            There is the danger of other youkai appearing in that area, so
            inexperienced people would do best in not copying this example.

            </b>
          </div>

            If it suddenly gets cold, there is a possibility that the ice fairy
            is nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            At such times you should be obedient and flee, or look for the shape
            of the fairy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies usually do nothing and keep their distance when they
            understand that they are noticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Cirno is easily noticed, I assume that as long as one is not
            very careless there is little risk of being injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, if you are to pass through place where she seems to be
            around, what's the best way of doing it?
          </p>
          <p>
            She's weak against fire from torches and other objects too hot to
            touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're holding a torch to start with she probably won't go near.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since she can freeze things she touches instantly, refrain from
            touching her even if she is asleep.
          </p>
          <p>There is a risk of frostbite.</p>
          <p>
            If by any chance Cirno should attack, just start to talk calmly
            about anything, and when she shows interest it is a good time to ask
            her a riddle.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you do that, she will start to think of the answer, and that is
            a good opportunity to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how simple the question, she can certainly not answer it.
