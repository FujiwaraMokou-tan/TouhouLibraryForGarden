            There are times when you get lost even on roads that are not
            particularly long .
          </p>
          <p>
            And in some severe cases, you return back to where you came from.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this happens, eight or nine times out of ten, you would be
            right to think that it is the work of a fairy. (*1)
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunny Milk, in particular, is a fairy whose specialty is making
            people lose their way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is possible to change how the environment looks from
            reality through refracting light, it can fool humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, as she can hide herself behind this diffraction, it can be
            difficult to capture her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her stature is quite short, and she possesses thin, insect-like
            wings.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's the type of fairy who plays terrible pranks on humans but gets
            away at full speed when they notice her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies like this won't approach humans that are highly cautious.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't want to get involved with them, you must behave as if
            always thinking of the possibility that a fairy is lurking nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, she rarely acts alone. She usually moves with a group of
            three. (*2)
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that she lives inside a huge tree in the Forest of Magic,
            but the precise location is unknown.
          </p>
          <p>Basically, a fairy's dwelling area can't be spotted by humans.</p>
          
          <p><i>*1: You can avoid being humiliated if you blame fairies.</p>
          <p>*2: The other two are Luna Child and Star Sapphire.</i></p>

            "I saw her basking in the sun on top of my roof. When I poked her,
            she ran away in a hurry." (Yumeta)
          </p>
          <p>
            "She was sleeping at the side of the road. She looked like she was
            hurt, but when I poked her, she ran away in a hurry." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>She has been seen basking in the sun a great number of times.</p>
          <p>
            And, as at many of these times she looked injured, it can be thought
            that, for a fairy of sunlight, exposure to the sun is the equivalent
            of medical treatment for injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I was walking, when suddenly the ground disappeared, and I fell off
            a cliff. I thought I was going to die." (Bamboo-shoot-hunter)
          </p>
          <p>Occasionally, the pranks become dangerous. Be careful.</p>
          <p>"I saw the rain bending in front of me as it fell." (Anonymous</p>
          <p>
            It can become easier to spot the light diffraction when it's
            raining.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's less likely for you to lose your way when it's raining than
            when it's sunny.

          <p>In any case, you have to be careful when you walk.</p>
          <p>
            There is the danger of the road in front of you suddenly turning
            into a river.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies will avoid attentive humans, and dogs with acute senses.
          </p>
          <p>If you are in a hurry, you should bring a dog with you.</p>
          <p>
            There is no danger in confronting her, as she will immediately run
            away. However, even if you want to punish her, it's almost
            impossible to catch her.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you fall victim of a prank, you can only curse your
            carelessness.(*3)
          </p>
          <p>
            She's extremely curious (*4), so an experienced person may be able
            to successfully set a trap for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's also apparently very fond of delicious foods, and she
            frequently tries to slip into feasts by hiding herself with optical
            illusions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you happen to spot her when she's distracted by the food, you
            have a chance to vent your anger on her.
