          <p>The princess of Eientei.</p>
          <p>Even her current activities are unknown.</p>
          <p>
            Eientei is a mysterious place which keeps lots of rabbits, even
            youkai rabbits, but it seems that she is its mistress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately Ms. Yagokoro has started selling medicine there, but until
            then nobody even knew of its existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            What have they been doing until now? What is the significance of
            this mysterious woman's organization? And the like. The mysteries
            surrounding Eientei only continue to intensify.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as the mansion has recently begun to host events and the
            inhabitants are beginning to appear in the human village, the
            opportunities to meet the proprietor of Eientei are increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The princess of Eientei is surprisingly refined in the art of
            conversation (*1), and will engage listeners in a variety of old
            tales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the blind biwa-playing monks of old were related to her
            somehow.
          </p>

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Ability</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            She possesses the ability to manipulate eternity and the
            instantaneous.
          </p>
          <p>
            As eternity refers to a world with no history, it is also a world
            where change is eternally unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how much you may try to bring about change in such a
            world, it is futile in a world where time has essentially stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is believe that even the fact that Eientei suddenly appeared in
            human history and began to experience the passage of time was
            because she undid the effects of her eternity magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the effects of that magic, Eientei would probably have never
            appeared in the human world, but would have always remained hidden
            in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost (*2).
          </p>
          <p>However, a perpetual world denies any sort of change.</p>
          <p>
            She may have lived for a very long time without having changed at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her other ability regarding the instantaneous is complementary to
            her manipulation of eternity, and allows control over extremely
            short time durations.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows her to act in instants so short as to be imperceptible to
            human beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since time itself is just the aggregate of instants, they pass
            normally as time, but these instants cannot be perceived by humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            In using these times, it's said that she can have several parallel
            timelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            As both of these abilities are abilities to manipulate time, they
            far surpass what normal humans are capable of.

                The Lunar Capital Exposition: "Creations of the Lunar Capital"
              </p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The exposition was an event where Eientei opened itself to the
            public to display various Lunar goods and informational exhibits,
            giving the public a chance to find out about the manor and the moon.
          </p>
          <p>Relations between Gensokyo and the Moon ceased long ago.</p>
          <p>
            The exposition was a great success among both humans seeing the
            subjects of the exhibits for the first time and among youkai who
            came to reminisce about the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the nobles of the Lunar Capital being hesitant to communicate
            with the beings of Earth, and it was a long time since so much
            discussion had occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sudden opening of the exhibition sent a shock through Gensokyo,
            and there were few whose interest it didn't capture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the displays at the exhibition could be divided into three
            categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first is the classic category of amazing items, such as
            carriages that fly through the sky, garments that make the body
            light enough to float through the air, the rabbits' mortars, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            These exhibits make it possible to imagine the lives of the nobles
            living in the capital of the moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next group, the military category, provided a stark contrast to
            the classics category: a vulcan cannon light enough to wield with
            one hand, an ultra-small Planck bomb, a roving tank designed for
            lunar exploration, and other modern weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gave viewers a glimpse at the incredibly advanced technology of
            the Lunar Capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final group was the academic category, which consisted of
            exhibits of materials: the books of lunar history, divine medicine,
            mathematical philosophy, mad grimoires, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the books were written on paper, they still used
            advanced technology: the pictures moved, solid forms would pop out
            of the pages, and unfamiliar words in the text would be explained in
            incredible detail if you simply touched them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, they were all written in the Lunarian language, and
            alas, completely incomprehensible.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the exhibition was extremely popular, the proprietress announced
            her intention to hold it yearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that they're preparing some sort of stage in order to
            hold a performance next time.
