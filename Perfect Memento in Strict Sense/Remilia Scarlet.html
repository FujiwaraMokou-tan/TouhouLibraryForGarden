            If one refers to vampires that are known to exist in Gensokyo, they
            must be the Scarlet family living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>Its mistress is the Scarlet Devil (*1), Remilia Scarlet.</p>
          <p>
            Her appearance and behavior might seem childish, but she has
            actually lived for more than 500 years and possesses amazing
            physical powers, as vampires do.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's short and looks as a little girl under the age of ten, but she
            has wings with a span wider than her height, and by looking at her
            silhouette, she may seem quite large.
          </p>
          <p>Her ego is large as well.</p>
          <p>
            Her actions are similarly childlike, and combined with her amazing
            strength and inexhaustible curiosity make her a fearsome devil that
            may explode at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            She sleeps during the day in the Scarlet Devil Mansion. At night,
            she takes walks or hosts a party and has as much fun as she can
            before becoming tired and returning to her slumber.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not sure whether or not she is using her ability to manipulate
            fate consciously, but it is said misfortune will befall those who
            are merely in her vicinity, and she can cause great change in the
            state of the daily lives of others with but a word.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, becoming more likely to encounter rare things (*2).
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            1: She was called the Scarlet Devil before coming to Gensokyo. This
            came from the fact that she often spills blood and stains her white
            clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            2: Actual results may vary, but there are no visual indication of
            when her ability is in effect.

                Anecdotes About This Youkai: Red Mist Incident
              </p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            This incident led to many humans learning of the existence of the
            Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was an incident where Gensokyo was shrouded in a deep red mist
            so the sunlight could not reach the Earth, leading to a summer with
            low temperatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inhaling the mist worsen the condition of those who did so, and led
            to people being unable to leave not only the human village, but even
            their homes over the course of the next several days.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was Remilia behind the appearance of this mist, with the selfish
            intent of blocking the sunlight so that she could remain active
            during the day as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that in the end, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine
            punished her to bring an end this incident.

            "I saw her at a cherry blossom-viewing party. She was using a
            parasol. If she's weak to sunlight, why doesn't she wait until
            night?" (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>She is a vampire who is often spotted in the daytime as well.</p>
          <p>It seems that parasols are ideal in blocking ultraviolet rays.</p>
          <p>
            "I saw her at a cherry blossom-viewing party at night. I guess she
            does it then since she's weak to sunlight." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather, it is highly possible she was at viewing parties for the
            entire day.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I was wounded and could barely move, but someone from the Scarlet
            Devil Mansion helped me and let me lodge in. They call it the
            Devil's Mansion, but she was unexpectedly kind. However, there
            wasn't anything much to eat, and since it was very noisy during the
            night, I couldn't sleep, so I ran away as soon as I could."
            (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>Vampires are surprisingly polite.</p>
          <p>Especially since they try not to eat the humans in Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            However, it might be that your fate to 'die like an animal' had been
            altered (*3).
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            3: Depending on how she changed fate, you might even become a
            half-human, half-youkai.

            Although she is a youkai with many weak points, it is not a good
            idea to exploit them and agitate her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since she cannot be exterminated under normal circumstances, you
            will most likely anger her and simply be blown away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since she has abundant curiosity, she may choose to invite humans to
            her parties or play in the human villages on a whim.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, because she is childish, you must be careful not to render
            her in a bad mood. Otherwise, there may be terrifying consequences.
          </p>
          <p>You will have to put up with her selfishness.</p>
          <p>
            She thinks that nobody is superior to her, not only among humans but
            among youkai as well.
          </p>
          <p>Because of her haughty attitude, she is friendly to none.</p>
