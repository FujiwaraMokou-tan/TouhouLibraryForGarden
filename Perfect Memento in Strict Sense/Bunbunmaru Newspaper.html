          <p>The once in a century or so Ceremony of Miare</p>

          <p>
            The Hieda family, one of the traditional families of the human
            village, has announced the birth of the new Child of Miare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her name is Hieda no Akyuu. With her, there are now nine generations
            of the Children of Miare (Girl of Are, Boy of Are).
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as the name "Child of Miare" says, she's the reincarnation of
            Hieda Are, who could remember anything after seeing or hearing it
            once, and this lineage has more knowledge of Gensokyo than any
            others in the human village for generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first Child of Miare was Aichi, who began the editing of the
            Gensokyo Chronicles. The Child of Miare knows the methods required
            for reincarnation, and is reborn a century and a few decades after
            death.
          </p>
          <p>
            The birth of the Child of Miare is called the Ceremony of Miare, and
            the Hieda family is held a festival to celebrate.
          </p>
          <p>The heir of Are is born only for editing books.</p>
          <p>
            Her brain is well developed but her body is weak. She's unfortunate
            for having a short life even amongst the short-lived humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            In exchange, the child has the memories of every generation of the
            heirs of Miare at birth, and is very intellectual and more
            knowledgeable than any other member of the Hieda family.
          </p>
          <p>The Gensokyo Chronicles is data gathered by humans.</p>
          <p>
            During the era of Aichi, it was for the purpose of helping humans
            defeat youkai, but it lost its original purpose as Gensokyo became
            more and more peaceful, and is now used commonly as a way to read
            about interesting youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, it lost its original meaning completely, being opened to
            the public even for those that are not human.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's more, she's the first Child of Miare after Gensokyo was
            closed up by the Great Boundary. I look forward to see what kind of
            Gensokyo Chronicles she will turn out.
          </p>

          <p>*Notice for the Birth Celebration of the Child of Miare</p>
          <p>
            To celebrate this happy event, the Hakurei Shrine has volunteered to
            hold a party. Participation is free, so it is expected there will be
            plenty of food prepared for the celebration...

          <p>I included this as commemoration.</p>
          <p>
            There's one thing wrong in this paper. In truth, the only memories
            left from the past generations are those related to the Gensokyo
            Chronicles.
          </p>
          <p>The part about being very intellectual is true though.</p>
