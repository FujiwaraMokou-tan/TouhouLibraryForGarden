          <p>
            If you go towards the Forest of Magic from the human village,
            you�fll see a strange building.
          </p>
          <p>
            This building is the antique store Kourindo. There are piles of
            items both inside and outside that no one entirely understands, and
            it's so quiet and gloomy that one can�ft know if it�fs really
            intending to do business.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the sole shop in all Gensokyo that deals with outside world,
            youkai, netherworld and magic items.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, not even the store owner knows how to use the outside world
            articles, and although there are many people interested in them,
            most of those items are not for sale (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            None of the merchandise has price tags, so when there�fs something
            you want, you will have to bargain with the store owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            And besides, outside items are frequently out of stock, so once they
            are sold you can�ft know when another is going to arrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then again, since no one knows how to use them anyway, they end
            up not selling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The owner, Rinnosuke Morichika, strangely doesn�ft make any
            distinction between humans and youkai, dealing with both of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, he is a human-youkai half-breed himself. He doesn�ft attack
            humans, and he is not attacked by youkai either (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though the path from the human village to Kourindou is somewhat
            long with many places where youkai are likely to appear, it's
            difficult to visit the shop casually, but there are many
            surprisingly interesting items there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don�ft interrupt the owner�fs stories though, he is likely to
            never stop.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            1: The reality is that the owner is a collector but him not being
            interested in selling most of the items is entirely a rumor.
          </p>
          <p>2: Maybe because of his disagreeable personality.</p>
