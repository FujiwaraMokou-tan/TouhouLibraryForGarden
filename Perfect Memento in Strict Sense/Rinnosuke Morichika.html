          <p>
            He is the owner of Kourindo, an antique store established at the
            entrance of the Forest of Magic.
          </p>
          <p>He is Kourindo's sole operator.</p>
          <p>He is not exactly human, but rather a half-human, half-youkai.</p>
          <p>
            Even though his lifespan is longer than those of normal humans, he
            is not very strong due to lack of training.
          </p>
          <p>
            He previously worked at the antique store owned by the Kirisames,
            but he started a store on his own, believing that in order to make
            the most of his ability, he needed to deal with ones that nobody
            knew how to use, not just common goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Items that nobody knew how to use, meaning items from the outside
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although he is very knowledgeable, he is prone to pondering by
            himself and not leaving the shop, as well as being cold even towards
            customers.
          </p>
          <p>Not a suitable attitude for conducting business.</p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Ability</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>He has the ability to perceive the name and purpose of an item.</p>
          <p>
            Even if it is an object he has never seen before, just by looking at
            it, its name comes to his mind, and just by saying this name, he can
            imagine what the object's purpose is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this is an extremely suitable ability for an antique
            dealer, it does have one fatal weakness.
          </p>
          <p>He is unable to determine how to use an item.</p>
          <p>
            Because of that, you must find out for yourself how to use of most
            items obtained at Kourindo (*1).
          </p>
          <p>
            But even so, there are some objects whose operation can be
            understood and performed.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using those, it is possible to benefit from the superior
            technology of the outside world, but he refuses to sell most of the
            usable items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, he is the only one benefitting from the technology of the
            outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though there's hardly a shop owner more unsuited to business,
            Kourindo is still the only shop that deals with items from the
            outside world, and because of this, it has its regular customers. <
          </p>
          <i>

              *1: There are too many outside world tools you can't figure how to
              use by intuition alone.

          <p>
            Just beside the Forest of Magic, there is a disheveled and unsightly
            foreign-style building.
          </p>
          <p>That is Kourindo.</p>
          <p>
            Rather than daily necessities, this shop deals in tools from the
            outside world, youkai items and netherworld articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Kourindo, neither humans nor youkai are ever refused, so anyone
            can visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            A great number of items are arranged haphazardly within the store,
            only comparable to a warehouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since no-one knows for what any of the items are used, if something
            interests you, all you can do is inquire the shop owner about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no prices listed and no way to know the market value so
            caveat emptor.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a large storeroom behind the store, and most of the items
            lying there are not for sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refusing to sell anything he finds useful or interesting makes one
            wonder if he really has any business spirit at all (*2), one of the
            features of Kourindo and its owner.

          <p>
            They come in a variety of shapes. However, not even the shop owner
            has successfully used one.
          </p>
          <p>To be frank, simply buying one would be useless.</p>

            The newer versions supposedly even allow one to communicate with
            one's ancestors in the netherworld. However, those too have not been
            successfully used as of yet.
