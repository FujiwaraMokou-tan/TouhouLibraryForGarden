            </b>
          </div>
  
          <p>These are youkai who dwell in the river near Youkai Mountain.</p>
          <p>
            They are technologically-gifted youkai that produce various tools
            with skillful hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to the tengu, they have built their own society, more
            advanced than us humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their appearance is human, but they have turtle shells covering
            their backs, and plates covering their heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swimming is their forte, and in the water they can move faster than
            a fish, but on dry land there is no major difference in abilities
            compared to a human's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their fighting skills are also comparatively low, so they seldom
            show themselves to humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, since they run away when they notice humans, their way
            of life is shrouded in mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they are spotted, it is just the occasional foolish kappa that
            has been washed down the river.
          </p>

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">The Tools of the Kappa</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The tools created by the kappa and the tools of the outer world are
            treasured as the two greatest varieties in Gensokyo today.
          </p>
          <p>However, it is unknown how to use most of the tools.</p>
          <p>
            The photographing devices used by the tengu are a good example of
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when the button is pressed, it remains silent for some reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others are the clock that somehow tells time correctly, and a device
            capable of talking to people over great distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mountain society is said to have become very advanced with these
            various devices, (*1) including ones for transmitting images to
            other places, as well as receiving them.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            1: It is also said that they are created by copying the devices from
            the outside world, but their waterproofing is outstanding.
          </p>

              <p class="textTitles">The Kappa's Lifestyle</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Swimming may be the kappa's strong point, but it is not as if they
            actually live in the water.
          </p>
          <p>Usually they live on land, where they also make their tools.</p>
          <p>If an enemy approaches they dive into the water and hide.</p>
          <p>
            However, while they can stay under water longer than a human, they
            cannot remain there forever. They must surface for air
            eventually(*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Kappa clothing is very water-resistant, so is possible to wear it
            into the water, and it won't interfere while swimming.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>2: They can hold their breath for several hours.</p>
