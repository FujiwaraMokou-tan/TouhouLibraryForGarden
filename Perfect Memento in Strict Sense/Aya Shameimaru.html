            Aya Shameimaru is a crow tengu who is considered to be quite fast,
            even among other tengu.
          </p>
          <p>
            She flies around Gensokyo with her camera in one hand, and when she
            finds an interesting event, she leaves with a few photographs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though she is a crow tengu, she looks basically the same as any
            human.
          </p>
          <p>She is never seen without her fan, her camera or her bunkacho.</p>
          <p>
            Her fan is a tool that allows her to summon the wind. One sweep of
            the fan can blow over a house, two sweeps can blow over a large tree
            and three sweeps can cause a traveler's cloak to fly away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her camera is another powerful tengu weapon which can capture a
            moment in time and display it as a picture (*1).
          </p>

          <p>
            The photographs she takes are later used for her newspaper articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her bunkacho is a tengu notebook where she writes down material she
            thinks could make interesting articles.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is filled with innumerable photographs and handwritten notes
            (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Her ability to manipulate the wind is a very straightforward ability
            that allows her to create and suddenly stop winds, as well as create
            tornadoes.
          </p>

          <p><i>*1: It also has an amazing shutter speed.</i></p>
          <p>
            <i
              >*2: It's said her handwriting is unexpectedly cute even though
              she's a tengu.</i

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Bunbunmaru Newspaper</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The newspaper that she writes articles based on the information she
            gathers is the Bunbunmaru Newspaper (*3).
          </p>

          <p>
            She normally writes about the unusual events caused by females in
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, even humans and non-tengu youkai can subscribe to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it has no set publication period, and she may have five
            issues in a month during a busy period.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the volume of articles in one newspaper is small, it's not very
            useful for gathering information.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is rather the sort of newspaper that is more suited for a human
            or youkai that wishes to whittle away a lazy afternoon perusing its
            pages while sipping a cup of tea (*4).
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*3: There are many in tengu society who create newspapers on
              their own. As a result, the newspapers tend to be biased.</i
            >
          </p>

          <p><i>*4: It is popular in cafes.</i></p>

            "I have so many of her papers piled up, I don't know what to do with
            them. Really. Even though I'm not a subscriber." (Reimu Hakurei)
          </p>

          <p>She delivers a mountain of extras.</p>
          <p>To tell the truth, I also have a lot of extras piling up.</p>
          <p>
            "It's such a bother how the crows gather around when we throw out
            our garbage." (Sakuya Izayoi)
          </p>
          <p>Those aren't tengu, but normal crows.</p>

          <p>The pen is mightier than the sword.</p>
          <p>
            If they're written up in her newspaper, even the mightiest youkai
            are no match for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every inhabitant of Gensokyo dislikes her presence, with that
            fearsome weapon, the "newspaper", along with her natural strength.
          </p>

          <p>
            She will come politely asking interviews of humans and youkai alike
            if she sees them worth writing an article about, but will forcefully
            drive away any who interfere.
          </p>

          <p>
            She is generally the sort of youkai one does not wish to oppose, but
            if one somehow manages to cross her, her strength is practically
            unrivaled.
          </p>

          <p>
            You likely won't have anything to lose by cooperating with her
            news-gathering.
