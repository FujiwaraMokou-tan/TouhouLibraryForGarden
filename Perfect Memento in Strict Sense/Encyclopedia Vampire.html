          <p>
            Of the newer youkai that have emerged only within the last few
            centuries, vampires are among the strongest of them, strong enough
            to take part in the power-balance of Gensokyo (*1) by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the day they spend their time in their mansion, and once
            night comes they become active; they are the Lords of the Night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their main diet consists of the blood of humans. Those whose blood
            has been sucked by one will neither die nor become a ghost. They
            will turn into a zombie for a while before evaporating under the
            sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            They went on a rampage when they first appeared in Gensokyo, lost
            against powerful youkai, and settled down after agreeing to a
            contract (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            The details of this contract are that the youkai will offer them
            humans from which to feed (*3); in return, the vampires will not
            attack humans living in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, the contract remains in effect to this day.</p>
          <p>
            Vampires have tremendous physical abilities and magical power: they
            are able to uproot a thousand-year-old tree single-handedly, to run
            through the human village within the blink of an eye, to summon many
            devils with a single word, to turn into bats or even mist to intrude
            anywhere they please, and they can recover within a single night
            even when their body is blown away, so long as their head is intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some youkai have abilities to this level of power, but only vampires
            are known to possess all of them.
          </p>
          <p>Because of this, they have charisma of the highest class.</p>
          <p>
            However, due to their extraordinary abilities, they have many
            weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, they are weak against sunlight, so they are docile during the
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither can they move through flowing water, so they are docile on
            rainy days. They also cannot cross rivers.
          </p>
          <p>They can't approach a sardine head or a broken holly branch.</p>
          <p>
            Their skin will be burnt if someone throws roasted soybeans at them
            (*4).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: The others consist of individual youkai, youkai living in the
              mountains (tengu, kappa and such), humans and animals.
            </p>
            <p>
              *2: A devil's contract is absolute, thus one can never betray it.
            </p>
            <p>
              *3: It is said these are humans from the outside world or those
              whose deaths are of no consequence (suicidal, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>*4: However, they seem to like fermented soybeans.</p></i

            Those as powerful as vampires are usually forbidden to directly
            assault humans.
          </p>
          <p>So, they aren't so dangerous even if you happen to meet one.</p>
          <p>
            Instead, they cause many disasters that affect the whole of
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can create abnormalities in everything including natural
            phenomena with no warning, for selfish reasons, which will always
            lead to endangering human life no matter what is affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these reasons are out of mere curiosity, and they will cease
            once they tire of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once a disaster has occurred, there is no choice but to seek help
            from a specialist who has the power to resolve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only thing an average human can do is find a way to survive.
          </p>
          <p>Aside from these times, vampires are relatively polite.</p>
          <p>They are usually not a threat.</p>
          <p>But that doesn't mean you should anger them.</p>
          <p>
            You shouldn't do something that strikes one of their weaknesses,
            even by accident.
          </p>
          <p>A halfhearted attack will only result in enraging them.</p>
          <p>
            In order not to unintentionally offend them, it's necessary to have
            a thorough knowledge of their weaknesses.
