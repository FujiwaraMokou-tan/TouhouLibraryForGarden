          <p>
            These are the gods that are found everywhere and have an especially
            deep relationship with humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, "eight million" is taken in its sense of "myriads"; a true
            count would probably be much higher.
          </p>
          <p>Since they're formless, you can't touch or converse with them.</p>
          <p>
            As for what their true forms are, they were in the form of all
            things before they were given names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when given a name, the gods' effects are faintly perceptible.
          </p>
          <p>
            These gods inhabit many different objects, but don't inhabit
            anything without a physical form.
          </p>
          <p>
            They run the full gamut from the fearful to the friendly, from the
            noble to the humble, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said that tools that host gods increase in utility according to
            the level of the inhabiting spirit (*1).
          </p>

          <p>
            <i
              >*1: It is also true that the god's grade is said to increase
              through use as well.</i
            >
          </p>

          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Rites for the Spirit Inhabiting a Tool</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            When you buy a new tool, you should pray to its spirit, and
            investigate ways to keep it from breaking (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            If it breaks at this early stage, it's said to be inhabited by the
            curse god of early failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you tell the shopkeeper about it, they may be able to exorcise
            the spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try using it every day, cleaning it well and treating it carefully.
          </p>
          <p>If you do this, the god's mood will improve.</p>
          <p>
            If it breaks and you buy a replacement, the spirit will become
            angry, and you will become cursed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid this, you must hold a proper memorial and get rid of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you neglect to do so, the spirit may become a tsukumogami and
            begin to move on its own and bring evil to its owner.
          </p>

          <p><i>*2: Don't forget to be respectful towards the god.</i></p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Tsukumogami</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The spirit of a tool that's used continuously for a long period of
            time may take on the thoughts of its owner and gradually attain
            divinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it's cast aside without a proper memorial, the god may not be
            able to return to normal, but into a tsukumogami, and it may move on
            its own in an attempt to inflict harm on its former owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            These spirits are more like youkai than gods, and can wreak real
            havoc against people, lacking a single redeeming feature.
          </p>
          <p>Please remember to properly memorialize well-used tools.</p>
