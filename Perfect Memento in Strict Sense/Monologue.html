          <p>
            I first began compiling the Gensokyo Chronicles about the time I
            turned 18 as Aichi, which was over a thousand years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Literacy was not as widespread in those days, so the Gensokyo
            Chronicles were more something to be left for later generations than
            something that was to be read by my contemporaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's difficult even for me to read the writing of the Chronicles
            from that era, so it didn't serve much use as a reference for this
            compilation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I've reincarnated as Ani, Ami and so on, and am now in
            my ninth incarnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, the process of reincarnation results in an almost total
            loss of memory, but the ability of Gumonji that my ancestor Are
            possessed has been preserved, that is, the power to not to forget
            anything that has been seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, as Akyuu, I have this power as well, and it has been
            extremely useful in compiling the references for this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somehow I know about things that happened during my life as Aichi,
            and even as Are, but unfortunately my memories of Gensokyo in
            ancient times are not very clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like a normal person, I have to read about the past to know
            much about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, it's quite obvious that Gensokyo has changed drastically over
            the past hundred years or so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The days where humans live in terror of youkai, or desperately
            exterminate them have passed, and the world has become a place where
            youkai come to the human village to play, and humans are invited
            into the houses of devils.
          </p>
          <p>
            This edition of the Gensokyo Chronicles is the first of these books
            to be written in the new Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>Nowadays, youkai almost never eat humans.</p>
          <p>
            As a result, I spent a lot of time worrying what to write about, and
            the usual warnings about youkai and descriptions of how to protect
            yourself from them followed as a result, but I spent some time
            arranging them a bit (*1) to try to provide a new youkai-centric
            viewpoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            I even tried picking out specific youkai and delving a bit into
            their personal lives, as I wanted to help create new relationships
            between humans and youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I received a great number of requests from youkai (*2),
            so what started out as a guide to help humans defend themselves from
            youkai was, before I knew it, a manual for youkai to help others
            learn about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, a number of the youkai threat levels have been inflated
            somewhat in this volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            This probably isn't too much cause for concern, as humans are almost
            never kidnapped and eaten by youkai in today's Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this rate, I may have to completely rethink the audience of the
            Gensokyo Chronicles and the purpose of their existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not, the purpose of my continued reincarnation may be diluted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once this edition of the Gensokyo Chronicles has finished, I should
            have as many people read it as possible and ask them if my continued
            reincarnation is necessary.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Still, the fact that we've entered into an age where there is
            practically no more use for the Gensokyo Chronicles means that this
            is a new, ideal era for both humans and youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are few threats to the humans' lives, and they can have
            peaceful duels whenever they please.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youkai extermination continues in name only, and abductions are only
            carried out for show.
          </p>
          <p>
            These peaceful, yet stimulating times are surely a golden age for
            humans and youkai alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's no doubt that Gensokyo has become the way it is thanks to
            the isolation brought about by the Great Hakurei Barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            About the time humans outside began to become more powerful and deny
            the existence of youkai, Gensokyo was already in danger of
            destruction(*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution endorsed by the youkai sages was to isolate Gensokyo
            using a great magical barrier.
          </p>
          <p>This barrier is the so-called barrier of common sense.</p>
          <p>
            This barrier kept the outside world's common sense outside, leaving
            what lacked common sense inside, in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            It created a world which embraced the youkai and the world of the
            night that the outside world denied, a world into which things and
            powers flowed as they were denied by the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>It was a passive, yet truly ground-breaking innovation (*4).</p>
          <p>
            Of course, the construction of the Great Barrier is almost an
            implicit statement by the youkai that they're no longer a necessary
            part of human society, isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's just the same as if they'd said, "Fine, we'll do as we please
            in here."
          </p>
          <p>
            One could say this desperate last resort was a smashing success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, perhaps it was the best possible plan, and not a simple act of
            desperation.
          </p>
          <p>However, there was a flaw in this plan, as well.</p>
          <p>
            That flaw was that the youkai's inability to attack humans began to
            weaken their powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            That meant that if a new and powerful youkai ever ceased to exist in
            the outside and passed into Gensokyo, its denizens would be unable
            to resist if it decided to subjugate them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this light, the Great Barrier can also be seen as a harbinger of
            Gensokyo's end.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, there was a plan to avoid this happening, as well.</p>
          <p>
            That plan was to have humans and youkai continue to battle each
            other in mock duels (*5).
          </p>
          <p>
            This is how today's pattern where youkai create disturbances every
            so often, and incident resolution specialists resolve them was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            This edition of the Gensokyo Chronicles also has a treatment of this
            phenomenon, which serves as a conclusion to the section which deals
            with youkai who attack humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youkai attack humans, and humans eliminate them. If even the
            appearance of this natural order were to vanish, Gensokyo's future
            would surely become a dark one.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            From my perspective, the power of today's youkai has not weakened;
            on the contrary, it's too much for the small area that is Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's probably evidence of the outside world forgetting about youkai
            one after another.
          </p>
          <p>However, no youkai ever try to invade the outside world.</p>
          <p>Why is this?</p>
          <p>
            I believe it's because youkai have no reason to attack the humans of
            the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            To that extent, the outside world has become the world of humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youkai are only mentioned in the context of tales in the outside
            world, and even in tales they only exist to be vanquished (*6).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, even though Gensokyo is as small as it is, no youkai would
            ever leave it to go on a rampage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being satisfied with the current state of affairs is the only path
            to happiness, but it is also probably the most difficult, and this
            isn't just true for youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certainly, expressing dissatisfaction is related to
            self-improvement, and can be a good thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it can also be a sign of greed, and avaricious souls only
            walk the path to their own destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enlightenment is knowing one has enough, and finding satisfaction in
            one's circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>The youkai have finally reached that point in their existence.</p>
          <p>This is the impression I get from today's Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            I would like Gensokyo to continue to be the unselfish and happy, if
            cramped, place that it is. (*7)
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Still, the humans called the Children of Miare -- to make a long
            story short, we are not able to live for very long.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know whether this is because the reincarnation is imperfect,
            or whether we simply know too much, but I will probably not live
            until thirty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, my preparations for the ritual of reincarnation must begin
            several years in advance of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, I will likely not have much of a chance to experience
            life as a normal human being.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my one regret, especially as it is much easier to enjoy an
            easy-going, pleasant life in Gensokyo now than in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ritual of reincarnation involves petitioning the Yama for
            permission during my lifetime; since it takes nearly a hundred years
            to prepare my body for the next reincarnation, I spend that time
            working for the Yama in Hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, even though it's become much easier to travel between Gensokyo
            and the Netherworld now, I won't be able to see how the conditions
            are in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardest thing about reincarnation has always been having all of
            my interpersonal relationships reset.
          </p>
          <p>This time, though, I think that things may change somewhat.</p>
          <p>
            This is because youkai and humans have become closer, so even I have
            youkai acquaintances.
          </p>
          <p>It's not unusual for youkai to live for several hundred years.</p>
          <p>
            Even if I spend over a hundred years in hell, all the humans I know
            will be gone, but the youkai will probably all look the same as
            ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the current state of Gensokyo has helped assuage the fear and
            loneliness I feel due to my reincarnation.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I wonder what the world will be like in the time of the tenth Child
            of Miare?
          </p>
          <p>
            Contemporary Gensokyo has been preserved as a perfect world thanks
            to clever youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current state of affairs, Gensokyo could continue to exist
            unchanged for quite some time.
          </p>
          <p>Today's Gensokyo is heavily dependent on the outside world.</p>
          <p>
            This follows fairly obviously from the fact that the Great Barrier
            is a boundary of common sense, but it is frightening to think that
            such an incredible power is unique to Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the outside world were to be destroyed, I wonder what sort of
            action the youkai sages would take.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suspect they would immediately dissolve the Great Barrier and
            begin their domination over the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the world of the night is the youkai's world, this could mean
            the world would once again regress to being a place of darkness.
          </p>
          <p>For some reason, I can't imagine that happening.</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the youkai of today's Gensokyo, I can only imagine the
            future of the youkai being a bright one.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the youkai who took action and quickly came up with a plan to
            create such an fantastic world, not the humans of the outside, and
            not the humans who exterminate youkai for a living.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't think that those same youkai would do something so foolish.
          </p>
          <p>
            We, the humans of the village, will continue our mock battles with
            the youkai in order to ensure the stability of their existence.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            This is not the end of the current edition of the Gensokyo
            Chronicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will probably continue collecting material for it until I must
            begin the preparations for my reincarnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until then, I would like to continue enjoying the black tea I (*8)
            love so much as I listen to Yougakudan songs.
