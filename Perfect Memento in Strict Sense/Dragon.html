          <p>The supreme god of Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            This god is worshipped by all living creatures, including humans and
            youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is believed to live in the ocean, or the sky, or in the rain
            (*1), but few have been able to confirm this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that a dragon looks like a serpent with hands and horns,
            that it is thicker than a great tree thousands of years old, and so
            long that it blocks out the sky.
          </p>
          <p>Its cry rends the heavens and causes thunderstorms.</p>
          <p>When it stirs, mountains crumble and earthquakes occur.</p>
          <p>
            Who knows what would happen to Gensokyo if something were to invoke
            its wrath.
          </p>
          <p>However, the dragon god is also Gensokyo's god of creation.</p>
          <p>
            It is thanks to the dragon that the rain falls, the rivers flow and
            that Gensokyo is enveloped in a verdant green.
          </p>
          <p>
            It rarely appears, and is said to show up only in Gensokyo's
            greatest times of need, blocking out the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proof of its appearances are the rainbows and rivers that manifest
            in its wake.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            1: As an aside, the dragon can go anywhere, regardless of the Great
            Border. It is said that it can move itself freely even to the
            outside world, the Netherworld or Hell.
          </p>

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">The Dragon at the Creation of the Great Hakurei Barrier</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The last time the dragon appeared in Gensokyo was when the Great
            Hakurei Barrier was created.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky was rent with constant thunder, the land was engulfed in a
            flood that threatened to submerge it, and for an instant, the skies
            were completely dark.
          </p>
          <p>
            The youkai sages staked their existence on pledging eternal peace to
            the dragon, and in an instant the waters drew back, the sky was torn
            asunder, and light was returned to the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, there has been a statue enshrining the dragon at the
            center of the human village, which is worshiped every day.
          </p>
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">The Dragon God's Statue</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            It's said the dragon god's statue in the human village is an amazing
            artifact that can tell you what the day's weather will be with the
            color of its eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When its eyes are white, it will be sunny. When they're blue, it
            will rain. When they're grey, it will be cloudy. It's very
            convenient (*2).
          </p>
          <p>But beware when the eyes turn red.</p>
          <p>
            Since this is the color reserved for indeterminate predictions, it
            appears whenever something truly strange is happening in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>In many cases, it was due to youkai-related incidents.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, this weather forecast is correct 70% of the time.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            2: It should be convenient, or the humans wouldn't come to worship
            it. It is said that the kappa who the chiseled the statue thought so
            and sneaked a forecasting device into the statue.
