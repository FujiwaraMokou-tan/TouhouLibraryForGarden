          <p>The live-in maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
          <p>
            The only human who lives in the house where devils dwell and leader
            of the maids.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mysterious girl who works in a place that normal humans don't dare
            approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nobody had ever seen her before she started working at the mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, she is ever an ally of youkai, and is cold-hearted
            towards human villagers who visit the mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            This suggests that she might not be a human from Gensokyo, but
            rather one from the outside or a completely different world.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she has no close relations with anyone in the human village, she
            is still shrouded in mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            She does come to the village to shop though, carrying a refined
            atmosphere around herself. She is never seen showing hostility
            towards other humans on such occasions (*1).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *1: Though she appears to act outright hostile while at the
              Scarlet Devil Mansion, this is likely because she is acting in her
              capacity as security for the mansion.

            </b>
          </div>

          <p>She has the ability to manipulate time.</p>
          <p>
            It is among the strongest of abilities for a human to possess, and
            is not something that can be learned through training.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manipulating time allows one to stop the flow of time and let only
            oneself move, to slow the flow of time and let oneself move at
            incredible speeds, or increase the flow of time and change apple
            juice to apple cider.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is generally rather difficult to revert things that have
            already happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things that have been destroyed, burnt down, eaten, etc. can not be
            returned to normal even if time is reversed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reversing time only has an effect to the extent that things that
            have been moved return to their original position.
          </p>
          <p>Effectively, you can say there is no reversing time.</p>
          <p>
            In addition, her ability can be used to manipulate space, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowing down time also means to contract space, and hastening means
            to expand it.
          </p>
          <p>
            She uses this marvelous ability to perform a great many tasks such
            as cleaning, laundry and cooking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides that ability, she is skilled in knife throwing and
            conjuration.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's said she can pierce an apple on the head of a fairy maid 20 ken
            far above her in the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            With her tricks, she makes things appear in her hand which should
            have held nothing (*2).
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *2: Please refrain from making tasteless comments like, "That's
              because she can stop time."

              <p class="textTitles">The Maids of the Scarlet Devil Mansion</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Scarlet Devil Mansion's policy regarding maids is quantity over
            quality, and they are somehow able to accomodate all of the fairy
            maids in their employ.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is the only human maid among them, and as the head maid she
            gives orders to the fairy maids.
          </p>
          <p>The fairy maids are mostly useless.</p>
          <p>
            They are sufficiently occupied in cleaning their own uniforms and
            making their own food (*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            About the only thing worth saying about these maids is that they
            basically have no pay or vacation, but they receive food and tea,
            and can do whatever else they please.
          </p>
          <p>They are free to leave and regain their posts, as well.</p>
          <p>
            The fairy maids' lives are comparatively comfortable, and if they
            can come to enjoy their masters' occasional impossible requests,
            almost none choose to run away.
          </p>
          <p>In contrast, the chief maid's job is severe.</p>
          <p>
            As her duties include cleaning the labyrinthine interior of the
            mansion, taking care of its selfish master, managing the useless
            maids, going out to buy supplies in the human village and making
            pointlessly gorgeous meals, she has no time to rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be impossible to do all this work alone without being able
            to stop time.
          </p>
          <i>
            <p>
              *3: Their existence doesn't really matter. The reality is that the
              head maid does most of the jobs.
            </p></i
          >
          <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
          <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px" />

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <b>
              <p class="textTitles">Her True Face</p>
            </b>
          </div>

          <p>
            Since the maids at the Scarlet Devil Mansion receive no time off,
            they have no private life. Thus, her character is not well known.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is unknown why she works in the house where devils dwell, and why
            the vampires trust her.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that she is not being forced to work by the vampires.
          </p>
          <p>
            She even seems to possess a certain degree of power in the Scarlet
            Devil Mansion, and can sometimes give orders to the vampires.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's still unknown whether the vampires sought out the services of
            her extraordinary powers, or whether she herself asked for the
            position of head maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, it is said that the name she bears now was given to her
            by the vampires, and is not her true name.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to one theory, she was a vampire hunter from the outside
            world or another world (*4), and followed the vampires into the
            Scarlet Devil Mansion to try to slay them, but was defeated instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reasoning behind this theory is that the silver knives she
            wields are those used for slaying vampires, and also because of the
            abilities the vampires possess.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had left for a remote location to train in slaying vampires.
          </p>
          <p>
            While she was skilled in defeating smaller demons, she had never
            tried her hands on a vampire.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, she had great confidence in her powers, and thought she
            would be able to defeat a weakened vampire easily herself, and,
            setting out on a journey to slay vampires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then once she reached the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she saw the vampire
            there who looked so young but was surprisingly strong, and was
            easily defeated instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vampire, wanting Sakuya's power for herself, spared her and gave
            her a new name, which also gave her a completely opposite fate (*5).
          </p>
          <p>
            From that point on she immediately became the vampires' servant, and
            since she had strong abilities, she was able to reach the position
            of head maid and even take a right-hand position alongside the
            vampires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, the Scarlet Devil Mansion relocated to Gensokyo, but she felt
            it clashed with the odd environment here (*6), so at first she
            resisted against the vampires and the humans of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, upon seeing the vampire whom she could not defeat easily
            beaten by a human from Gensokyo, and that they both got along as if
            nothing had ever happened afterwards, she slowly began to open
            herself towards those around her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, it seems that something has broken through her facade, and
            while she still allies herself with the vampires, she has been more
            proactive in encountering humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's possible that the vampire who manipulates fate planned
            for everything to be this way from the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>What do you think of that theory?</p>
          <p>
            Also there are many theories such as ones suggesting she is actually
            a Homunculus, a zombie or simply just an eccentric, but the most
            widely believed theory is the vampire hunter theory detailed above.
          </p>
          <p>
            She claims to be in her late teens, but this is unlikely judging by
            her refined manner and the level of her abilities. Rather, she seems
            to be a human who has been living for hundreds of years (*7).
