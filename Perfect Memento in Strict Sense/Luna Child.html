          <p>
            I believe you might have had an experience in which, during a windy
            day, the wind's sound suddenly vanished, even though the wind hadn't
            stopped, and then soon after the sound came back again.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this happens, eight or nine times out of ten, you would be
            right to think that it is the work of a fairy(*1).
          </p>
          <p>Fairies are beings that can't harm nor benefit humans.</p>
          <p>Their pranks don't necessarily cause direct harm to people.</p>
          <p>
            Luna Child has the ability to silence the sounds around herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            This in itself can't cause much harm, but she often joins up with
            other fairies, particularly Sunny Milk and Star Sapphire, carrying
            out their pranks as a trio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her stature is quite short, and she possesses thin, insect-like
            wings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the red, white and blue trio of fairies, the white one (*2)
            is Luna Child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the three fairies, she might be the dumbest one, or maybe she
            just relies too much in her ability to make sound vanish that she's
            often the only one who fails to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems that when her ability is used along with Sunny Milk's light
            diffraction, it can hide both form and sound, producing a truly
            fearsome stealthiness. But even so, they are still fairies, after
            all.
          </p>
          <p>They are not very smart.</p>
          <i>
          <p>
            *1: You can avoid worrying about your hearing if you blame fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            *2: Sunny Milk is red, and Star Sapphire is blue. These are the
            colors of their clothes.

            "I often see her tripping while walking down the road. She's kinda
            dull." (West side woodcutter.)
          </p>
          <p>
            "Even though she could walk without a sound, she was tip-toeing."
            (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>One of the characteristics of stupidity.</p>
          <p>Frankly, you might not even feel like punishing her any more.</p>
          <p>
            "I saw her flying around by herself in the middle of the night."
            (Star-watching poet)
          </p>
          <p>
            She's more active at night, so that's when she's most frequently
            sighted.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, she will begin to move independently of the others.
          </p>
          <p>Maybe she's in a particularly unusual class of fairies.</p>
          <p>
            "She steals a lot of coffee beans (*3). I wonder what I could do
            about it." (Teahouse owner)
          </p>
          <p>
            With no sounds to expose them, it's difficult to guard your
            belongings from sneaking thieves.
          </p>
          <p>But a counter-measure will be mentioned ahead.</p>
          <i>
          <p>
            *3: Fairies who love coffee are rare. The preferences of fairies are
            often the same as that of human children.
          </p></i>

              <p class="textTitles">Countermeasures</p>

          <p>
            Even though she can cause little real damage, she basically acts
            with other two, so the same countermeasures mentioned for Sunny Milk
            can be employed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, out of her solitary pranks, sneak thievery is often reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            To counteract this, the most reliable method is to be always making
            sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this fairy gets close to anywhere there is noise, you will know
            she is there because it will become silent.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means she won't get caught if she doesn't use her ability, but
            being a fairy, she will be unable to realize this.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has associated silencing her surroundings with her thefts. She
            won't think of doing it any other way.
