            Technically speaking, poltergeists are not yuurei, but there are no
            other appropriate classifications for them so they are described
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The youngest sister of the Prismriver Ensemble(*1), Lyrica
            Prismriver plays the keyboard and percussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her body(*2) is the smallest of the three, but her music is dynamic.
          </p>
          <p>Her appearance is no different from that of a human.</p>
          <p>
            She is the shortest of her sisters, and thrashes about during live
            performances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The keyboard she plays is said to be the yuurei of a synthesizer
            used by a famous artist that created sounds that were too peculiar
            so it never sold and faded into obscurity(*3), but it's unknown if
            this is true or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her personality is the most human-like among the sisters, so she's
            easy to converse with.
          </p>
          <p>However, she does have a sly, worldly side to her.</p>
          <p>
            The sounds she creates are sounds that don't exist in the present
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sounds are the sort of sounds one can't imagine where they came
            from or how they were created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than the yuurei of notes, one might say they're illlusionary
            notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to her sisters' sounds, they are unlike anything heard
            before, but they don't resonate with the mind and spirit, and are
            heard normally with the ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since they have no effect on the mind and spirit, you can listen to
            them without worry.
          </p>
          <p>She normally performs together with her other two sisters.</p>
          <p>
            If she ever acts on her own, she is probably quarreling with her
            sisters or has some ulterior purpose in mind.
          </p>

            She's small but her instruments are large, so she really doesn't
            stand out.

          <p>Hang in there.</p>

            She is very friendly to both humans and youkai, so you have nothing
            to fear from her.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will probably never come across her on her own, but mutual
            understanding shouldn't be difficult, so you can avoid any danger by
            talking to her.
          </p>
          <p>Also, poltergeists can't just sit still quietly.</p>
          <p>
            So, even if they're carrying on or talking incessantly, they're not
            necessarily angry; just settle down and cope with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you happen to cross her through some off chance, the best thing
            to do is retreat and run as if the death itself were after you.
