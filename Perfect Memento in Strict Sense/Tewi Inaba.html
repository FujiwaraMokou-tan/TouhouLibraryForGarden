            Tewi Inaba is the youkai rabbit that acts as the leader of the wild
            rabbits.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is a rabbit who has managed to live a long life by taking good
            care of her health.
          </p>
          <p>She can assume human form and understand human speech.</p>
          <p>
            This youkai rabbit is also known as the Rabbit of Good Fortune, and
            it's said that those who see her will be blessed with good luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, not only is she very fleet-footed, but she spends much of
            her time in the Bamboo Forest, so it isn't very easy to spot her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has a very mischievous personality, but can be cowardly and
            shifty.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is extremely emotional, to the point that her personality is not
            unlike a fairy's.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said she spends most of her time in the Bamboo Forest and
            lives at Eientei.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, she has lived in the Bamboo Forest since before Eientei was
            built, and is said to be one of the longest living youkai in
            Gensokyo (*1).
          </p>
          <i>
          <p>
            *1: Her presence had already been confirmed at the time the Gensokyo
            Chronicle was first compiled.</i>

            Lady Luck will be visiting me from now on..." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>
            Good fortune does not last very long, so you may have exhausted your
            share by simply making it back safely from the forest.

            "Ah, rabbit meat is plain so it goes well with any other side
            dish."(Owner of Kourindo)
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbit meat is just one kind of popular cuisine in Gensokyo (*2).

            "Even if I catch rabbits in my traps, there are never any youkai
            rabbits inside." (Anonymous)
          </p>
          <p>Of course, youkai rabbits are pretty clever.</p>
          <i>
          <p>*2: It's a favorite of mine, as well.</p></i>

          <p>
            Due to her reputation as a bringer of good fortune, she is unusually
            popular among humans for a youkai, but one can't find her by
            ordinary means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her inclination to stay in the Bamboo Forest only compounds the
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the forest to find this rabbit would certainly be reckless.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dense fog and monotonous scenery in the bamboo forest confuses
            your sense of direction, and the forest is full of youkai, so it's
            unwise to enter it unprepared.
          </p>
          <p>
            One might say that it would be good fortune enough in finding her.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may be that good fortune only visits those who were fortunate to
            begin with (*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Incidentally, compared to a four-leaf clover, her good fortune on
            the order of a forty-leaf clover.
