          <p>
            At first glance they seem to be regular animals, but they are
            intelligent enough to understand human speech and have unusually
            high physical abilities, plus some of them can use sorcery.
          </p>
          <p>These kinds of animals are known as Beasts.</p>
          <p>Many of them act like leaders for normal animals.</p>
          <p>
            Characteristically, we can say they are very physically orientated.
          </p>
          <p>
            They possess superior physical prowess (*1), but in contrast it is
            difficult for them to be restored if their bodies are destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike normal youkai, they're resistant against mental attacks (*2).
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, their shape, personality and powers are strongly influenced
            by the animal from which they originated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unity within their species is strong, and they won't bear other
            member of their species to face hardships.
          </p>
          <p>
            They tend to be omnivores who prefer to eat meat, especially human
            meat.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that animals that have eaten too many virtuous humans
            become beasts (*3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of them are very ferocious, and since the frequency of
            encountering one is somewhat high, you must be careful of this type
            of youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, more tails generally means higher youkai power, so you can use
            this to estimate their strength.
          </p>

            <i>*1: Swift feet, the ability to jump high, having great strength,
            being able to see even in the dark, to see and hear things from
            afar, having delicious meat, etc.</i>
          </p>

          <p>Most of their danger comes from direct attacks.</p>
          <p>
            Even if they can only scratch with their sharp claws or bite with
            their teeth, they are a threat to humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible to be injured even if you don't directly get involved
            with beasts. For example, if you catch a rabbit, a youkai rabbit may
            take revenge on you if it notices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, you must be even more careful of beasts that can use sorcery.
          </p>

          </div>
         
          <p>
            Because of the difference in physical abilities, humans are at an
            overwhelming disadvantage in a frontal attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, since many of them aren't too smart in general, they often
            fall into traps set by humans.
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes they'll get caught in rabbit traps.</p>
          <p>
            If one of them is threatening to fight you, it's probably because
            it's hungry.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have food on hand, there's a good chance you can escape by
            offering it to them and running.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the worst case, if you don't have any food on hand, or you meet
            them one after another and you've just given away your food, all you
            can do is pray.
