                <p>Every one is busy doing something at the year end, but that is why so many business are prospering. And it looks like there is a newcomer to the service in competition.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>It's said that when children were playing around a dried-up well, they had found a person's skeletal remains. At that time, the well was supposed to be off limits.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Have you heard of the word "Christmas"? It is an event that a saint called Nicholas comes from a foreign country, flying in the air as he whips animals, and sneaking in houses legally while the owner is a sleep. This open-minded event is already a boom in the outside world, and it looks like we already have a sign of its boom appearing in Gensokyo.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Seiga Kaku (Hermit) is the one who is trying to do business by taking part in the boom. She says that with her ability to go through walls willingly, she is planing to sneak into human houses.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"In the outside world, you hand out toys after you sneaked in. I guess it's an event that gathers faith from children by doing that. And doing business by selling the toys to Santa Claus (St. Nicholas), is how Christmas is worked out."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>But claiming that it wasn't enough Seiga spoke:
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"Why in the world should I need faith from a white-haired old man, and you don't even know if he is here in Gensokyo in the first place? If that's the case, it would be difficult to sell toys to him. So, I decided that I'm going to sell toys directly to the owner, or take something valuable if they're asleep."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>With her words, she showed me her bag full of treasure. Indeed, It really looks like a great business. I believe that humans and hermits are going to have a huge battle around at the time of Christmas next year.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Incidentally, St. Nicholas has its image of his white hair, but when talking white-hair in Gensokyo, we tend to picture Sarutahiko more. Since he is also the God of us tengu, Having a negative image will be a bit undesirable. We just hope Seiga would not do her Christmas wearing white-hair.
                </p>
