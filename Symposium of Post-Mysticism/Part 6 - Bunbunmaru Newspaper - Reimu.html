                <p>At the Xth day of the Xth month before daylight, Hakurei Shrine had collapsed due to a local earthquake.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>But strangely, there have been no observations of the earthquake which caused the collapse of the shrine. We can only know the occurrence of the quake from the witness otherwise known as the shrine maiden, Reimu Hakurei.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>"I felt a strong quake that was like thrusting me up. In a moment, the shrine fell down like its roof was dropping!"
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>The shrine did not seemed to be pressured by a strong force from the outside, nor did it not looked like it was destroyed by a power other than an earthquake. There were no large scale crack, or fault on sight nearby. Perhaps it was a work done by a relativity small giant catfish.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>The shrine had its roof simply fall down so it would not be a hard to rebuild, which was fortunate for the shrine since it was a relativity old building. Without finding the reason of the collapse, perhaps the same thing will just repeat again, even if the shrine's restoration is complete. What I am trying to say is, this quake trouble has a concern of a cause made by an artificial factor.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, there was an event taking place while I was writing this article. Someone who had taken the liberty of rebuilding the shrine had appeared. And that certain someone is a heaven dweller as the rumor goes......
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>It is not that I am doubting anything, but a celestial who would pop out right after the quake and accept the rebuilding of the shrine; I must say this story is sounding a bit too good. It would do a serious damage to Gensokyo if something catastrophic happened to the shrine.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>I have snapped as many pictures that I could possibly take of the destroyed shrine. We possess the ones who are skilled at building among our colleagues. I can only hope that the situation in which they would become useful will not befall us......
