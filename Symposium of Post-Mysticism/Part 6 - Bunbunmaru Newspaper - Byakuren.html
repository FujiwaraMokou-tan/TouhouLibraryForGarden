                The Buddhist Service for the Youkai at the Night of Summer
              </p>

          <p>
            The Buddhist service held at Myouren Temple is on the topic of
            conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Held for the first time at the very-new Myouren Temple built this
            summer, it is said that this Buddhist service is very thrilling and
            exiting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before we go further, what is a Buddhist service in the first place.
            A Buddhist service is a study meeting held for teaching the way of
            Buddhism. While it sounds nothing but dullness, what does it mean by
            being so thrilling and exciting? The chief priest Ms. Byakuren
            Hijiri talks to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The way of Buddhism indicates the training to attain enlightenment.
            In another words, it will lead to exorcising evil spirits from the
            human soul. But in this case, our Buddhist service is done for a
            youkai, so..."
          </p>

          <p>
            I guess she wanted to say, attending a Buddhist service itself would
            be a lead to deny your own existence, which is another aspect of
            evil spirits lurking in the human soul. Truly, that sounds like a
            thrill.
          </p>

          <p>Though, Ms. Hijiri continues:</p>

          <p>
            The state of enlightenment is "Form is the emptiness. Emptiness is
            the form", thus it is said to be a substance which is born by itself
            from the flawless soul. It may be that youkai are actually close to
            enlightenment, since having a denial of themselves is directly
            connected to the denial of their existence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unceasing inquiry has been made from the youkai to Myouren Temple.
            Why are the youkai, are willing to take part in the Buddhist
            service. I have questioned a youkai who was attending it.
          </p>

          <p>
            "You know, isn't it just too hot these days? I came here 'cause I
            heard of a ghost stories meeting during the Buddhist service that
            was being held, but geez she sure is good. She is really good at
            story telling with pure fear, it really makes my heart 'n soul
            tremble for the best. The Heart Sutra was it? Boy, ghost stories
            couldn't have been better.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Heart Sutra is the most famous sutra in Buddhism, and there are
            many others. After I told him that, he said "Buddhism, I like it. It
            sure knocks out horrors from the heart" as he shivered with joy.
