        <p>At this time, a discussion is brewing about constructing a road to the shrine from the village during
            the winter holidays. However this seems to be a point of concern for some of the Tengu.
        </p>




        <p>The Moriya Shrine wants to construct a road that anyone can use before the end of the year, which is
            the most profitable time for them. However, from within the ranks of the Tengu that live in the
            mountains there are a few who are stubbornly against this asserting "We are not letting anybody in".
        </p>



        <p>The God of the Moriya Shrine, Kanako Yasaka (God of the Mountain), spoke on these close-minded
            mountain youkai.
        </p>


        <p>"I'm sick of these far-fetched arguments the white wolf Tengu are making. It's not like we're making
            this road to let people wreak havoc on the mountain. In fact, it will allow for an increase in the
            mountain's faith, which will increase their own power. I can't help but think they only have the
            brains to justify their desire to not go outside."
        </p>


        <p>In response to this, the white wolf Tengu replied curtly, "It is our duty to keep watch on
            intruders."
        </p>

        <p>As it is right now, the praying of respects at the Moriya Shrine is a rare occurrence. This cannot be
            helped due to the White Wolf Tengu on guard. Seeing no other way, they established a branch shrine
            in the valley to allow people to come and pray respects, as well as conducting business by
            themselves and gather faith from humans.
        </p>


        <p>However the shrine has devised a new plan. That is the establishment of an "arial tramway" from the
            Human Village to the shrine.
        </p>


        <p>An arial tramway is a cage held up by a rope which allows for the transportation of humans and
            luggage. If this was made possible, visitors would be able to visit the shrine without needing to
            pass through any other locations. As long as they don't pass through anywhere else, there is no
            reason to turn them away.
        </p>



        <p>In response to this plan, the Tengu leader Dai Tengu gave the following opinion:
        </p>



        <p>"If the shrine dedicate us some offerings on that cage then we might give it a try to consider."
        </p>


        <p>With firm resolution. It appears that they are willing to get whatever they could out of it and won't
            do anything.
        </p>



        <p>A cage watched over by the Youkai...I can only think it being nothing more than a target. The shrine
            side looking to open up the mountain to visitors, the Tengu side looking to keep it closed off,
            opinions divided in Youkai Mountain. It doesn't seem like this will be resolved easily.
