<p>A satori like her older sister Satori; however, she is a satori who had closed her own mind and has become unable to read others' minds.
</p>

<p>Since she cannot read minds, she no longer has anything that would make others hate her, but since her own mind is blank, she is also unable to be liked by anyone. Her presence cannot be felt except by coming into one's field of vision. Even if one can see her with their eyes, it would still feel as if she did not exist(*1). When she disappears from one's field of vision, one immediately forgets her.
</p>

<p>In actuality, she came above ground some time ago, but she was not reflected in anyone's eyes. Once her older sister Satori's existence was known, at last it became that Koishi could be recognized as well.
</p>

<p>However, she's loved by the wordless animals. To the animals, being able to read minds is a unique power. For that reason, there are many animals living in the Palace of the Earth Spirits(*1).
</p>

<p>Unlike her older sister, she is not liked by animals. She is not hated either.
</p>

<p>That is how Koishi is like, but her older sister worries about her. She, who has no mind, is also unable to be seen by her older sister, but still, she has not disappeared from her older sister's mind.
</p>

<p>As her personality is empty like this, just like her older sister, it is difficult to engage in communication with her.
</p>

<p>1: An existence like a roadside stone.

<p>
</p>
<p>Rather than saying that she considers her own actions before performing them, she frequently performs actions on-the-spot as she feels like.
</p>

<p>Just like you can raise your right arm, without realizing that you're doing so, she performs all of her actions unconsciously. Because of that, not only others, but even she herself, cannot understand what she will do next.
</p>

<p>Also, this doesn't mean that she lives in devotion to desires. She probably doesn't have any desires. Like a piece of cloth fluttering in the wind, she lives going with the flow.
</p>

<p>It is said to be difficult to comprehend the unconscious, even for trained monks. However, can you really say for sure that it is a good thing to become like her? I'd like to ask the monks at the Myouren Temple about that topic.

<p>She is neither liked nor hated, as that is her nature, but it seems like there are also those who yearn for her.
</p>

<p>She does not have complex human relations, but it looks like she gets on well with children.
</p>

<p>A youkai invisible to adults, and only visible to certain children. Even those who played with her in their childhood will completely forget that she existed, once they grow up. Has anything like that ever happened to you?(*2)
</p>

<p>She is called an "imaginary companion." Koishi is, no doubt, that kind of imaginary friend herself.
</p>

<p>2: Not to me

<p>Her threat level is unknown.
</p>

<p>Even you catch sight of her, she doesn't do anything, so it is probably not necessary to take countermeasures.
</p>

<p>However, just don't try provocative acts. It is because if by any slim chance, she recovers as a youkai satori, nobody would benefit.
