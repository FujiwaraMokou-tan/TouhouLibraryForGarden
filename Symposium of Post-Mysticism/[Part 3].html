                <p>But once Buddhism started spreading Shugendou, tengu became objects of mountain worship. They were
                    like spirits that alternately helped and hindered the mountain priests(*1) who were crowding the
                    mountains for training. From the ordinary person's perspective, the monks undergoing intense
                    training were no different from the tengu, and soon they were conflated. Because of that, modern
                    tengu still have a monk-like appearance.

                <p>Because youkai knowledge is my specialty. Since great mountain ascetics are called hermits, I believe

                <p>Incidentally, the long-nosed tengu that humans often picture seems to have started in the Edo Period.

                    rituals.

                <p>The crow tengu are the newspaper reporters and deliverymen, so they're the only ones who come down
                    from the mountain, but there are lots of other tengu deep in the mountains. The long-nosed tengu are
                    clerks, so they don't get out much.

                    also take a leadership role during festivals. But then because of the Westernization of Japan,
                    folklore became superstition, shugendou gave way to secularism, and they were forgotten about along
                    with humanity's fear of the dark. The tengu who depended on working together with humans could no
                    longer come outside. For this reason, the existence of the youkai was endangered. This isn't limited
                    to tengu, all youkai were...

                <p>That's right. I wasn't here at the time so I don't know how this came about(*5), but when Gensokyo
                    entered its current state, youkai were released from the spell of human imagination and obtained
                    true freedom. Those whose form was never fixed could now develop their own originality. I don't
                    really understand what kind of transformation occurred, but probably because the tengu were
                    originally a strictly hierarchical youkai, they've built up the kind of society they have now.
