<p>A Hell Raven who inhabits the inner depths of Former Hell. Most of the youkai who inhabit Former Hell moved in when the place had turned to ruin. It appears however that the Hell Ravens were there from the beginning, native inhabitants if you will.
</p>

<p>Thanks to the recently established connection with the above world, the existence of this endemic species(*1) has been confirmed. A bird born from the darkness of hell, it does not have the specific characteristics of a youkai.
</p>

<p>But, she is a special existence even among them. She possesses the named divine spirit within her body. Possessing a divine spirit means you have become like a walking branch shrine. It is a difficult feat for both humans and youkai. It could be only done by one having no personality, as well as being unnamed, and without attachments, as well as having a great deal of tolerance that accepts everything. A lot of effort is also necessary. The easiest way would be to make your head completely hollow.
</p>

<p>She has a queer appearance. Although she takes this mysterious appearance, she has the "Leg of Fission" which the existence of is suspicious, the "Leg of Fusion" which looks heavy, and she has a canon-like object on her arm; This, in fact, is the "Third Leg" which is surprising to be a leg. She also has the bright red "Red Eye" on her chest; all of these are due to the affect of the Yatagarasu which she took in.
</p>

<p>She doesn't come to the surface or interact with humans much so her personality is unclear.
</p>

<p>What can be confirmed with certainty is that the inside of her head is pretty hollow.
</p>

<i><p>*1: Animals and youkai which could be only seen in a specific isolated environment, that they have been given birth to.

<p>
</p>
<p>The divine spirit taken inside of her, Yatagarasu, is a high status divine spirit that could appear even in the Records of Ancient Matters.
</p>

<p>It is said that the Yatagarasu is a raven that lives within the sun. While a bit rough on the eyes, it's possible to see its form from above ground. This form of the Yatagarasu is the thing referred to as a 'sunspot'. Approximately once every 11 years its power grows, and it is said that sunspots can be seen in great numbers at that time.
</p>

<p>This God's power is the power of the sun, a divine flame. It is this power that has become hers.
</p>

<p>The divine flame is above that of extreme heat, so it will continue to burn even if left as-is. This makes it extremely difficult to control. Her power is less the ability to release the divine flame and more, how to put it, utilize it by means of controlling it.
</p>

<p>The reason she came to take in this divine spirit appears to be a cause made by Kanako Yasaka.
</p>

<p>I wonder what the Yatagarasu had in its mind for being sent to the Former Hell to divide spirits with the hated residents, while it has the high-loyalty and the divinity that couldn't be any more.

<p>While they don't come above ground very often, it's at least worth remembering that such youkai exist below ground.
</p>

<p>By the way, thanks to this youkai a hot spring has appeared. One should take time to enjoy this blessing.
