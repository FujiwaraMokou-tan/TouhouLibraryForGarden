            Aren't they? The youkai and the like are beings who have been
            forgotten or are no longer needed by the outside world, while humans
            exist just as much in the outside world. So if humans only exist to
            keep the youkai alive... then they become the same as beasts or
            fish.

          <p>
            You're trying to make it sound like they're just food, but if beasts
            or fish didn't exist it would also trouble the humans, they have
            that kind of cooperative relationship. For example, if I couldn't
            receive faith from humans then I wouldn't be able to use my powers.
            So in order to obtain faith, I have to support the humans'
            livelihood, and we enter a give-and-take relationship. So even if
            the youkai of Gensokyo continue to quarrel, there shouldn't be any
            chance of the humans disappearing.

            So essentially you're saying that even if the humans are completely
            helpless, they should have peace of mind simply because there's no
            risk of them disappearing.

          <p>
            Huh? Didn't you say earlier that humans were being threatened by

            The lack of risk refers not to individual humans, but to the human
            species. Individual humans will of course continue to live in fear.

            "Even if I die, I'll just be reborn, and if I can't be reborn I'll
            be fine as a yuurei." That's surely how they think. Rather than
            that, what they're scared of is their existence being denied
            completely.

            When it comes to survival I believe that's true... However, a

            To be honest, I think of Buddhism as a political tool. It corrects
            the disorder in human nature, it accepts anyone into ascetic
            training, it's no exaggeration to say that this is all for the
            benefit of statesman. From my perspective, teaching Buddhism to
            youkai is nonsense. It's just playing house.

          <p>
            Buddhism is a philosophy that denies your existence and then
            reaffirms it. To the strong-bodied yet heartless youkai, shouldn't
            it be quite easy to teach them this philosophy? It is most
            unfortunate that you cannot understand the bright future for both
            humans and youkai that this would result in. To use this only for
            political ends is evidence of the user's immaturity.

            I must say calling her just a tiger is a bit weird, but as you know
            tigers have never lived in Japan. Back when scholarship was coming
            in from the continent, the fact that an animal called a tiger
            existed was known only through words. The imagination of people
            wondering what they looked like gave birth to Shou as a result.

            Unlike youkai, gods are fine even when their natures are changed by
            themselves. The stories that are created to change their natures are
            called "myths". Using these, we can freely change our own natures.
            Currently, the humans and youkai of Gensokyo are in the middle of
            creating my myth together, but because I'm not receiving faith well
            as a mountain god, I'm gradually becoming the god of technological
            innovation.

            Wouldn't it have been better to choose a divine virtue that could

          <p>
            From the Shinto perspective, gods are the true natures within all
            things. Originally, gods exist namelessly in nature or in tools.
          </p>

          <b>

          <p>Doesn't that contradict the fact that you yourself are named?</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: -1em; margin-top: 0em">Kanako:</p>
          </b>

          <p>
            When gods are named their powers are restricted, but they receive an
            ego. They lose the ability to exist within anything, becoming no
            different from youkai, but in return receive an ability related to
            their myths.
          </p>

          <b>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -1em; margin-top: 0em">Byakuren:</p>
          </b>

          <p>
            So basically, gods are youkai whose ability changes depending on
            myths.
          </p>

          <b>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -1em; margin-top: 0em">Kanako:</p>

          <p>
            However, if they lose all their faith, they return to their former
            existence. As for youkai, they disappear when forgotten, but they
            prevent that through threatening people or causing disturbances,
            rather than through faith. If a god who did nothing but threaten
            people lost its faith, it would become an ordinary youkai.

            Stray gods without shrines(*7) often get reduced to youkai. Because
            it's difficult to gather faith like that. By the way, who was this

            Ah, that feral god... I believe she had a sister(*8), a god of
            autumn colors, but honestly it's because there are so many famous
            harvest gods. Like Ukanomitama... So all the faith ends up going to
            them. There isn't much competition in the god of autumn colors
            market though, so it's probably easier to gather faith with that.
            Combining fallen leaves and potatoes, you get the gods of roasted
            sweet potatoes, so if they set up a nice kiosk in some corner of the
            human village I think they could gather a lot of faith(*9).

            In the end, the Tao is the Cosmic Truth. How to use this Truth isn't
            something that Taoism teaches. It is evil when used by the evil, and
            good when used by the good. That is something Seiga taught me
            through her actions.

            Are you saying it's up to the person? I could only think that when
            you obtain power, you just get yourself destroyed by desires.
            Personally, that is what I've come to deeply understand, I differ
            from you.

            Desires are also a part of one's self. The truth is that it is
            impossible to separate from them. Even by chanting as many sutras as
            you like, a mature priest can't understand this?

            Actually, Ms. Seiga has been going around bothering people. At this
            rate, it wouldn't be surprising if someone destroyed her. If other
            people don't, I might do it myself...

            Well, let's leave that aside. Even though we went through the
            trouble of gathering three religious figures, this topic hasn't
            advanced at all. I can see you've all been going back and forth,
            exchanging mutually exclusive opinions, but in the end what exactly
            is religion?

            Jokes aside, religion is a method of understanding the world.
            Science and magic are also the same, they're all forms of
            scholarship.

            There are so many because they're using their words differently,
            it's at that level. If the words differ, the principles will be
            distorted through transmission, which can cause fighting. But for
            all religions there is but one desire. To avoid experiencing
            hardships. In order to protect themselves, people rely on gods or
            cling to Buddhas.

            That may certainly be true. Even if it may sometimes cause religious
            wars, those are also ways that people protect themselves.

            I don't see how bothering other people is protecting yourself, but
            does that mean that all religious people are pacifists?

            Yes, the youkai that live in my temple won't fight unless necessary.
            It's never necessary to fight unless you've been harmed.

            That's certainly a commonality. If I had to say it, humans without
            ideologies or religious faith tend to hurt others with their
            short-sighted greed or jealous rivalries.
