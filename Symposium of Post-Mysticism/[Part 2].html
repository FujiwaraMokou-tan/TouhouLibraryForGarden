            <p>Advancing? It depends on what you're referring to. Their technology is such that Gensokyo cannot even
                compare. They have almost everything they've ever wanted, the death rates among humans are extremely
                low, news gives equal treatment to anyone and everyone, and they are always able to fill a desire for
                information. It's just like a paradise.

            <p>Ah, I thought you'd catch that. Hardly anyone disciplines themselves anymore, so the human spirit hasn't
                changed for a thousand years. However, once the world became such that everyone's material and
                information needs are filled, even the average human began to realize that material things alone can
                never bring happiness.

            <p>(Ignoring Marisa) But given this country's state and its immaturity of spirit, it hasn't been able to
                make the transition very well. The essential requirement to achieving fulfillment is to raise one's
                spirit level, but of course that isn't such a simple thing. It's difficult for anyone who wasn't either
                born a saint or has achieved enlightenment. That's where gods come in. Humans fear gods, and gods
                forgive humans, is the line of thought. With this, even an ordinary person can hold this same sense of
                morality and dedicate themselves to a stranger.
            </p>

            <p>So what, you're just saying 'worship me'? That's all just self-justification. And the outside world
                doesn't acknowledge the existence of gods, right?

                never have asked for... This time, she actually brought back a youkai tanuki friend of hers from
                outside.

                possible.

            <p>Let's see... the topic of youkai and evil spirits came up just about every day. Who had been abducted by
                them, who had exterminated them and become a hero... those were pretty standard topics for conversation

            <p>That's right, it's no different. That's why someone as old as me can blend in without feeling out of
                place at all. By the way, my followers, Futo and Tojiko(*5), used to be afraid of youkai and curses and
                such, and then before long, others ended up in fear of "the ghost of Mononobe" or "the curse of Soga" or
                what have you. (laugh) Maybe that was when I first understood the true nature of youkai.

            <p>Wishing they were there does not equal believing they exist. "I wish they existed, but there's no way" is
                how they think. Let's take shrines as an example. Gensokyo's shrines are inhabited by gods, humans visit
                them to show faith to the gods, and the gods that receive the faith bestow some modest power on the
                humans. This is a blessing.

                no, there's absolutely no way they exist." Like that. (laugh) Actually, in addition to power spots,
                there are also "mystery spots"... which means places where ghosts appear. I first learned this after I
                came to Gensokyo, but those mystery spots are actually what happens when ghosts go out to play and such.

            <p>Because the youkai of Gensokyo owe their reason for existence to humans forgetting about them, it would
                be better to accept their extinction in the outside world.

            <p>Yup. Well, I don't think modern humans will ever seriously believe that youkai actually exist, but it
                might be possible for a new style of youkai to be born.

            <p>Yeah, there's a history of youkai being born from phenomena that harm humans or a fear of the unknown.
                But the new style of youkai would be different. They'd be intentionally created, or born from permitted
                irrationality. They might even become mainstream.

            <p>You mean they'd be born to smooth out the unbalanced hearts that made made youkai disappear in the first
                place.

            <p>Because the human heart is truly good at dealing with circumstances. In that area, humans surpass youkai.

            <p>Hey, I can't understand a word of this explanation. It's like you're all talking in another
