                <p>While bathing outside, a female angel hung her veil on a tree which later was stolen by a human. The angel who now had no chance of returning to heaven, starts to live with the human by no choice. This is the famous known veil legend.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, the so-called veil marriage act - angels hunting for their partners using that method - is in fashion now.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Although, the term "angel" indicates a variety of meanings up to tathagata and flying humans, the life of a lower-ranking angel is not one filled with wealth, particularly in the Gensyoko seen today. It has been a while since angels have lived a poor life even worse than humans. Unexpectedly, the hierarchy of heaven life is heavy, it is said that unless you're a humble one who wishes for almost nothing, you are going to have a cramped life.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>The content of the veil marriage act goes like this: after you lose your veil near the human village on purpose, you will marry the man who picked up the veil if you like him, telling him you can't return to heaven. If you don't like him you will take the veil back, but...
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>This is a comment made by Iku Nagae (messenger of the Dragon Palace).
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"Veil marriage act? Yes, I heard that it's a boom among a few cheesy angels for sure. But, since these veils are provided from the lord of the heaven, we'll have to write an apology letter if we lose it or make it dirty. For crying out loud, it can be only done by idiots who aren't aware of the future."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>There is even distrust among humans for lost veils. The village elder gave the declaration "Do not touch a veil left on the ground."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>The veil legend ends with the angel finding the hidden veil and returning to heaven, leaving her children and husband. Maybe the angels intend to return to heaven whenever they feel bored of their life on the surface, but that is just heartless.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>However, I heard that very rarely heaven veils are on sale at the Kappa's bazaar and an antique store which is thought to deal in stolen goods. There's no way the collectors will miss the chance of claiming a veil. If it was the humans who sold veils, it would appear then that the humans are the clever ones.
