<p>
</p>
<p>One of the kappa living in Genbu Marsh. There are unusually many kappa, so they've created their own society. This is about kappa in general, but they're unusually skilled with their hands and excel at making tools. She has engineering skills at a level that humans cannot even understand. However, she doesn't offer her skills to any but a small group of youkai.
</p>

<p>In her backpack and pockets she keeps every kind of implement, material, fuel and mysterious substance. Even though she has no trouble making any kind of physical tool, she is somewhat bad at producing cursed artifacts and magical items.
</p>

<p>Because of her timidness, if she is alone she will run away when approached by humans or youkai. Among other kappa she seems to be bright and fun-loving, but when alone after failing to run away, she adopts an arrogant attitude. Deep in her heart she seems to look down on humans and other youkai, and she's terrible at hiding it.

<p>
</p>
<p>Her ability to control water isn't done through tools, but through her own power as a kappa.
</p>

<p>I can only guess what the full extent of the control is, but she can do things like create fountains, shoot water, and water tricks.
</p>

<p>Encounters with the kappa don't happen very often, but it is dangerous to get near their hideout. This is because they can use their control over water to drown people.
</p>

<p>They have a characteristic called tsuuhai. Tsuuhai is a feature meaning that their arms are connected and able to stretch or shrink them freely, but it is said that it looks like they are just using a tool to stretch their arms.

<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>


<p>
</p>
<p>Periodically, they open the Kappa Bazaar. With the goal of gathering a budget, they sell products that they're proud of.
</p>

<p>While there aren't many other opportunities to get your hands on valuable kappa tools, since other youkai also gather at the bazaar, it is difficult for humans to approach.
</p>

<p>However, there is value in going despite acknowledging the danger. While I don't know what they're selling, the moment when you finally find what you're looking for is supreme bliss(*1).
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Camera Machine... A tool that copies the scenery onto paper. The theory is unknown. It absorbs the souls of humans caught in the center of the frame.
</p>

<p>Phone Machine... A tool that sends voices to faraway places. The theory is unknown. Sometimes picks up the voices of ghosts.
</p>

<p>Calculator Machine... A notebook that can not only be written on, but can also do calculations. The theory is unknown. Sometimes locks up.
</p>

<p>Vacuum Machine ... An automatic sweeping tool. The theory is unknown. I wonder where the things it inhales go to?
</p>

<p>Shiriko Device ... A tool for cleanly extracting shirikodama. Don't need.

<p>
</p>
<p>If you get close she'll pull you into the river and extract your shirikodama. Humans that have their shirikodama extracted die. Because there's a ferociously brutal part you should be careful.
</p>

<p>The tsuuhai-using tool is also another reason that people can't meddle with her. This tsuuhai is the reason why she could grab the legs of people even when they're walking a ways from the river. It can extend further than you think, so be careful when near the river.
</p>

<p>Since she loves cucumbers, she'll often let you go if you give her one.
