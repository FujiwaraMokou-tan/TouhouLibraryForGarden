                <p>Those were the words made by the fairy when I was at a flower-viewing party. From what I heard, it looked like there was a championship of deciding the strongest between the fairies while we were busy enjoying the flowers. Unfortunately, I could not collect stories from them, but I happened to find Cirno (Fairy) there being carried away by the enthusiasm from the title of the strongest she had achieved.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>"Well, the youkai-flower-viewing party has already been dismissed ....... But I saw someone who was wanting to use her spare energy, leaving and heading toward that direction."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking it was an interesting matter, I guided the fairy and tailed her from behind.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Marisa Kirisame (Human) was the one who stood at the end of my guide. What will happen if we strike a fairy who is arrogant about there power, to a human who usually hangs out often with fairies. That was my observation for the mean time.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"Interesting. Let me find out how much could I enjoy myself by dealing with a fairy!"
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>An entertainment between a drunk human and a power-drunk fairy has begun. Although there was nothing special to report since it was a heartwarming activity, it was quite impressive to see how Marisa was enjoying the easy-going fight dealing with the fairy. Especially the part where she wasn't fighting with her lasers that she was proud of, made me amused.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to youkai, humans are a specie that live a life of labor. They are so desperate to live everyday, even when dealing with fairies they need to take a risk of death. But I have discovered that among some part of humans, there are ones who can deal with fairies easily without any problems.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>This fact should be kept in mind of any old youkai who still possesses memories of past humans. Even though I had thought that I would not care much if the human loses by a bit of luck in this duel, the result was no where near that point, and I observed the outstanding growth of human kind. It could be that youkai having the idea of humans always becoming the victims, would lead to the cause of making us youkai extinct someday.
