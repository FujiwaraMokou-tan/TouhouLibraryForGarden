                    <p>I am Byakuren Hijiri. I am the chief priest of the Myouren Temple(*2) on the outskirts of the
                        village. Although I'm the chief priest, I'm still a novice yet to attain enlightenment, so I'll

                        Gensokyo today, so I was determined to attend. Speaking of which, the people of Gensokyo are
                        quite friendly, to have a talk like this...</p>

                    <p>My first impression of Gensokyo is that by ignoring youkai who harm others, the human heart
                        becomes frivolous and apathetic. The humans of the village while away their days in that
                        apathetic state, failing to improve their lot in life, and the youkai are allowed to freely take
                        advantage of their frivolous hearts. Frankly, it's a miracle that society hasn't collapsed yet,
                        and I believe the current balance is dangerously unstable.

                    <p>Gensokyo's current form cannot be maintained without the youkai's power(*4). Gensokyo was created
                        by youkai to save themselves, after all. The humans in Gensokyo exist for no further purpose
                        than to preserve the youkai. The humans are being ruled by the youkai.

                    <p>I agree. The youkai run rampant, ruling over the humans, and keep watch to make sure the humans
                        don't realize this fact and advance along the wrong path(*5). Therefore, the fact that a ruler
                        hasn't emerged from among the humans is in Gensokyo's best interest.

                        them. Taking a naturally free bird and locking it up in small cage... when you look at things
                        from that perspective, it seems quite unfortunate. But now, it doesn't have to worry about
                        predators, or running out of food, and there will always be plenty of humans for it to meet, so
                        it will never get bored. If you think of it like that, isn't it fortunate?

                        <p>I am just a simple monk in training, but because of a minor disagreement, I was betrayed by
                            humans and sealed away... Even still, some of my old friends who missed me came to my
                            rescue.
                            And then I just happened to find myself in Gensokyo.

                            out
                            to be something that seemed more dangerous than what we were expecting, we thought we should

                        <p>If so, what of it? This country is full of misunderstandings about religion, and people
                            who
                            oppose religion. One of the reasons for that is because religions that abuse faith are
                            also
                            spreading. It's an unfortunate matter. Originally religion was something used to support
                            emotional growth. Just like sports players use the latest theories to train their bodies
                            to
                            perfection, to become emotionally rich and feel happiness you need to use theories and
                            morals,
                            which is what religions are for. In Gensokyo just like the outside world, our duty is to
                            make
                            sure people don't become successful yet emotionally immature.
