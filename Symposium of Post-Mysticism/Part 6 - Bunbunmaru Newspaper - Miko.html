            The day of gengshen is the day when you talk about staying up late
            at night. The day of gengshen is one of the days of the sexagenary
            cycle which has sixty days. And in that day, it is said that even
            humans who do not go out at night fearing the youkai, gather around
            and be drunk until morning. When, and why this custom had started is
            not known. Although night has become comparatively safe, the custom
            of drinking has not changed.
          </p>

          <p>
            But it looks like this day of gengshen is meeting the time of
            change. Ms.Toyosatomimi no Miko (Hermit) says:
          </p>

          <p>
            "Bugs called the three worms live inside the human body, these bugs
            are the ones which are responsible for decreasing your life span by
            reporting the sins you have committed to the Lord of heaven, after
            they sneak out of the body on the day of gengshen at night. So, your
            sins wont be revealed if you keep your eyes on them without sleeping
            on the day of gengshen."
          </p>

          <p>
            This is the reason why the party of the day of gengshen has started
            she says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "But everyone just get dead drunk in today's parties, making the
            bugs go out carelessly. Such a pointless thing to do. That's why I
            developed 'The Four Wise Monkeys'. With this, your life span can be
            endless. Indeed it's the don't die."
          </p>

          <p>
            With full confidence, she took out a set of four dolls, portraying
            monkeys with poses of 'Do not see, Do not say, Do not hear', coming
            with a additional one with a pose of 'Do not escape'. She says that
            these dolls are programmed to chase the bugs stubbornly if they are
            on sight of crawling out of the human body. So with these dolls on
            standby, the bugs will be caught, and never will be able to reach
            the residence of the Lord of heaven.
          </p>

          <p>But, would this not be against the will of the Lord of heaven?</p>

          <p>
            "Though everybody say he's the Lord of heaven, reality says
            differently. Those bugs are actually planted by the Shinigami from
            hell, and reports are in fact delivered to the Yama. These bugs are
            meant for business by them, so humans should resist against them by
            all means."
          </p>

          <p>
            The final goal of the Hermits is to achieve immortality, and their
            biggest enemy is the Shinigami. And for notice, she says The Four
            Wise Monkeys are open for order and will be on sale at an open price
            (And will be expensive).
