<p>
</p>
<p>The chief priest of Myouren Temple. Although she was originally a human, she has already surpassed them from many years of training. So to speak, she is categorized as a magician.
</p>

<p>Although she entered the priesthood, for some reason she loves youkai. She does not banish demons with a word like in a fairy tale. Even though she's a saint, the powers she wields are evil. Though apparently without a trace of hostility towards humans, she's an ally of devils and youkai.
</p>

<p>Before she came to Gensokyo, she was sealed in Makai by humans. The reason was probably something like fear of people with powers we disagree with. The seal was undone by youkai who adore her. Because we sealed her, it's natural to think that they hate humans.
</p>

<p>She seems very respectable, but because she won't drink alcohol or eat meat for religious reasons that forbid killing anything, it's difficult for her to befriend humans(*1).
</p>

<p>As for her work, she manages funerals and a graveyard, teaches the dharma to her disciples and beyond, and overall leads an early-to-bed, early-to-rise lifestyle. Above all else, once a month she holds an all night monotone sutra chanting live concert with a wooden fish setting the rhythm, attracting attention from both humans and youkai(*2).
</p>

<p>Her personality seems gentle but somehow unreliable. She adores youkai that don't desire conflict. She never shows any anger and gives the impression of a good-natured old grandmother. But because there are many aggressive youkai, this attitude instead feels somewhat disgusting.
</p>
<i><p>*1: It needn't be said that drinking parties are very important to the Gensokyo social life.
</p></i>

<i><p>*2: This event is not popular. Humans find it sleep-inducing, and youkai get hyper-alert and fidgety.
</p></i>

</div>
<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
<p>
</p>

<p>As the result of her training, she acquired an ability. Among the special abilities that humans can acquire, the term "magic" is often used, although in reality, that describes a diverse set of things.
</p>

<p>Her magic is derived from Buddhism. However, she's strayed from the path of Mahayana Buddhism (*3) and possesses demonic power. Most likely she won't be able to enter Nirvana.
</p>

<p>Her magic is a body improving system. By chanting a spell, she can make her fists harder than steel, sharpen her five senses, or even be unharmed inside the Hakkero, but normally she's only as strong as a powerless human. Her long life and ageless body are also the results of her magic. If you wish to attack her, you should probably aim for times when she's defenseless.
</p>

<i><p>*3: Which has the dubious idea of saving everyone by helping them escape from suffering.

        <p class="textTitles">Sorcerer's Picture Scroll</p>
    </b>
</div>
<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>

<p>
</p>
<p>The scroll she carries (called the Sorcerer's Picture Scroll) has written on it the sutras she needs to use her ability. I say "written on", but the scroll itself is a spell(*4).
</p>

<p>Because of that, compared to a paper scroll the amount of content it can contain is infinite. Moreover, it is said that it won't deteriorate with time. It also comes equipped with an auto-sutra-chanting mode; simply hold it out and it will recite spells on its own.
</p>

<p>Apparently she made it because of all the free time she had while sealed in Makai. Of the many materials that exist in Makai, there are things that contain their own will. Because the Sorcerer's Picture Scroll has its own will, other people are unable to handle it. In Gensokyo, we call such items "cursed". Therefore, the Sorcerer's Picture Scroll is cursed(*5).
</p>
<i><p>*4: Apparently paper scrolls are too old-fashioned.  
</p></i>
<i><p>*5: In the outside world, it appears they call it "infected by a virus".
</p></i>

</div>
<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>

<p>
</p>
<p>It's hard to definitively say whether or not she has any hostility towards humans. However, because she follows the religious precept of not killing, it's unlikely that she'll suddenly attack you.
</p>

<p>Rather than that, you should be worried about her youkai followers. Of the youkai that visit the temple, there are a number that clearly violate the teachings. There are youkai that strive for Hijiri's power, as well as those that target the humans visiting the graveyard.
