<p>The bourei of a human from ancient times. Carries a grudge against humans, her nature is that of the so-called vengeful spirit.
</p>

<p>Although she serves Toyosatomimi no Miko as a vassal along with Mononobe no Futo, she didn't become a shikaisen like them, instead remaining as a bourei. As for why, she seems to have been set up by Futo.
</p>

<p>To begin with, Futo and Tojiko were mutual enemies from the struggle over Buddhism. Although in the end Tojiko's side won, it seems she responded to Futo's appeal to work together in secret. The details of the plan were along the lines of "We'll let Buddhism rule for now, but after Miko revives and becomes a powerful leader we can both revive as her chiefs of staff."
</p>

<p>The temporary body that she's using is a jar(*1). She wanted to move to a new body that would never decay, but Futo switched it with an unbaked jar. If Tojiko attached her soul to it, it would easily melt away. To prevent that, she gave up on having a physical body and remained a bourei.
</p>

<p>As for why Futo did such a thing, it's surely because of a grudge from the conflict between their two families that led to the downfall of the Mononobe. Although she realized the deception immediately after becoming a bourei, it turned out that not having a physical body was surprisingly pleasant so she doesn't seem to mind too much.
</p>

<p>Her personality is ill-bred and tender-hearted. She also has a hot temper. When angered she literally makes thunder fall, because of this she poses an immense danger.

</p>
<p>Making thunder fall is actually a common ability among vengeful spirits. Vengeful spirits are just clusters of anger, but as we call the act of raging "bringing down thunder", anger and thunder are quite closely related.
</p>

<p>For small vengeful spirits, at best they can make a rumbling sound, but as their resentment level increases they can make a sparking sound, and greater spirits can actually bring down thunder.
</p>

<p>As she can bring down thunder around her, she's seems like a reasonably high class vengeful spirit.

<p>Vengeful spirits are dangerous to both humans and youkai.
</p>

<p>The way to deal with her is to simply not get near her. If you do meet her, try not to make her angry.
</p>

<p>Fortunately, her grudge has almost disappeared, so she's become just an ordinary thunder causing bourei. If you take care not to provoke her, there should be few problems.
</p>

<p>Incidentally, idiots and thunder like high places, so thunder falls on high places(*2). If you happen to anger her, you should lower your stance.
</p>

<p>2: It's the same as the stake sticking out of the ground getting struck down.
