                <p>The discovery of the supposedly never-before-seen shogi pieces in the kappas' possession has become a subject of discussion.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>In the widely-known game of shogi, the jem (Or a jade: Equivalent to the king in chess), the gold, the silver, the branches of a Katsura tree and the fragrant woods are the treasure, which the pawns and two dragons protect. Since using just these pieces means it doesn't take long to decide a winner, the white wolf tengu have adopted "Great Tengu Shogi" which has a multitude of additional pieces and unique rules made by them.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Great Tengu Shogi adds many treasure pieces, with beasts and youkai protecting (hunting) them. It is common for a single game to take several days.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Pieces which have been currently found include the "general", "lieutenant general", and other such pieces, which supposedly are promoted versions of pawns. There were also pieces like "airplane" and "spy", whose effects are truly unimaginable. There was nothing written on the backs of any of these, which means they can't be promoted.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Momiji Inubashiri, the white wolf tengu who has been active in adding pieces and expanding rules until now, had the following to say.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"I thought that it was only us who were making original rules. I cannot believe my ears to hear that the same kind of things were happening in the outside world as well, it's a bit frustrating."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Though she says that, she is devoted to make more rules for the new pieces.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>"I want to see how shogi in the outside world has evolved with my own eyes. There is the possibility that the rules have been simplified, since all of the new pieces which were found couldn't be promoted. In that case, we tengu might have to enjoy something which has become unsatisfactory."
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Currently, it is said that the outside world has finished post-war reconstruction and is at the height of rapid economic growth. It is very likely that games which take hours to play have been simplified and can be played easily. If that is the case, then even with regards to shogi, Gensokyo is probably evolving in the complete opposite direction. Although separated by just half of a century, it looks like cultural differences cannot be stopped.
