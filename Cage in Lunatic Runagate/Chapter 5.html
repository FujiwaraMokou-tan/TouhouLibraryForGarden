        <p>As anybody living on this Earth knows, the moon always shows the same side as it orbits the planet. No matter
          where and when on the Earth, the moon does not appear to change.
        </p>




        <p>Because of this, the moon was thought of as a picture drawn on the roof of the heavens.
             Because the patterns on the surface were consistent,
          people compared them to a number of different images. The rabbit is one of them.
        </p>




        <p>How can the moon show the same face and orbit at the same time? It is simply because the moon's rotation
          period and orbital period are highly synchronized. If the moon can rotate once at the same time it orbits the
          Earth once, it can orbit without showing its back. It's like a hammer throw or a ball in a net. In the same
          time it takes for the ball to revolve around the thrower, the ball itself makes a complete revolution.
        </p>




        <p>Yet there are still questions, such as why the moon came to possess such an orbital period.
        </p>




        <p>Did the residents of the moon make it so that they can live their luxurious lives while concealing themselves
          from the people of Earth? Or was the Lunar Capital so heavy that centrifugal force made it face the
          outside...?
        </p>









        <p><img
          src="./CH5_01.JPG"
          class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide"
        />However, she, Yukari Yakumo, knew that the reason was quite scientific yet foolish.
        </p>




        <p>Since explaining the reason using physical properties of gravity and how it operates when large planets are
          present would be too easy, too scientific, and so unfitting for Gensokyo, she had to think up another reason.
        </p>




        <p>Gensokyo was separated from the outside world by a border of common sense, and it existed within the borders
          of uncommon sense. To maintain the border as the way it was, everything needed a backside.
        </p>









        <p>-The night of the new moon.
        </p>




        <p>When the moon is shrouded in shadow and becomes invisible, the moon on that night is called a "new moon". But
          why is it called that? People like us who are more accustomed to the solar year would not know this, yet we
          don't think of it as strange.
        </p>




        <p>I often make trips to the lake of Gensokyo to see the moon. Tonight is like any other, and I gazed at the new
          moon. Of course, there was nothing reflected on the lake.
        </p>




        <p>Yet I was able to see the bright backside of the moon that was bathed in sunlight.
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari.”
        </p>




        <p>The fox in front of me calls my name. This fox, Ran Yakumo, is my loyal shikigami.
        </p>




        <p>"Lady Yukari. It appears the vampire's rocket is finished. I went to have a look myself, but I worry about
          their well-being if they are going to journey on such a thing."
        </p>




        <p>Saying that, Ran's mouth bent into a smile. Whether the smile was laughter at the vampire's rocket or an
          untrusting snicker at me, who had done nothing in response to the vampire's plans despite the information we
          had gathered. I wished it was the latter.
        </p>




        <p>"Ah, that must have been a rather busy party, then. But why was I not invited?"
        </p>




        <p>I already knew Ran had secretly attended the party.
        </p>




        <p>“Well, I wasn’t there because I wanted to be. I was just spying to see what it was like... Should I have
          called you as well?”
        </p>




        <p>“Of course, although if you asked me, I would’ve gladly turned you down. Anyway, do you remember the orbital
          period of the moon?”
        </p>




        <p>“Huh? The moon’s orbital period...? On average it’s said to be about twenty-eight days, but actually it’s
          only about twenty-seven and one-third days. But since the Earth is rotating around the sun as well, if one
          period is starting from a new moon, the time it takes to go from the full moon and back to the new moon is
          said to be thirty days, yet that, too, is actually shorter, being twenty-nine and one-half days. However,
          wouldn’t you be more knowledgeable about it?”
        </p>




        <p>“You’re right. The orbital period is not twenty-eight days, nor is the period of waxing and waning a full
          thirty days. This is an important fact.”
        </p>




        <p>In the lunar calendar, the new moon is the first day, and as it was the rebirth of the moon, the moon on this
          night was called a “new moon." In a similar manner the moon on the third night was called “mikazuki” and the fifteenth night,
          “juu-goya” was a full moon. In such
          ways the moon matched the dates. The lives of people back then was centered much more around the moon's cycle.
        </p>




        <p>“In order for there to be a new moon on the first night and a full moon on the fifteenth, a month would need
          to be thirty days.”
        </p>




        <p>“Yes, that would be so.”
        </p>




        <p><img
          src="./CH5_02.JPG"
          class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide"
        />“But in reality, the moon’s orbital period is not thirty days. Because of that, the fifteenth night is rarely
          a full moon. Don’t you think that is unnatural?”
        </p>




        <p>With my question, the fox in front of me went into thought.
        </p>




        <p>“The night of the fifteenth should be a perfect night... True. Perhaps somebody moved it on purpose?”
        </p>




        <p>“That’s not it. I think you know, but the rotation period as well as the orbital period is twenty-seven days
          and a third... I would like you to go look for the reason for me.”
        </p>




        <p>Although I said to look for the reason, I wanted her to think of it herself. If it’s just research work a
          computer would suffice. In the
          outside world there are increasingly more people who become devoted to their shikigami and turn into empty shells. By asking for something
          more from a shikigami than their usual tasks, I am trying to improve the boredom of everyday life.
        </p>




        <p>“*Sigh* Very well, I suppose. Anyway, back to the vampire’s rocket...”
        </p>



        <p>-The night of mikazuki.
        </p>




        <p>The moon of mikazuki is also called a sword. It probably comes from somebody picturing those sharp points as
          a sword.
        </p>




        <p>As if to challenge this sword-shaped moon, a large shooting star was climbing into the night sky. I hear that
          a shooting star burns out because of poison in the atmosphere, but if that is shooting upwards, is the dust of
          the earth burning out?
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari, can you see?”
        </p>




        <p>“I can see you. No need to come so close.”
        </p>




        <p>“No, not me... I mean the glint of light shooting into the sky. It appears the vampire’s rocket finally
          launched. That light is the rocket.”
        </p>




        <p>"Mhmhm. Yes, I can see <b>without getting so close</b>."
        </p>




        <p>“I see. As for the light, from its speed I’m guessing that it was calculated to reach the moon by the full
          moon.”
        </p>




        <p>“My, that’s quite a leisurely voyage. If they’re that slow maybe we’ll arrive before them..."
        </p>




        <p>Ran had a puzzled look on her face.
        </p>




        <p>“But I believed we were meant to leave for the moon on the same day, and since we would arrive in an instant,
          we would reach the moon at the same time as the vampire and the others... And this has been bothering me, Lady
          Yukari, but why did you make the vampire go to the moon?”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh, but I didn’t say a word about wanting them to go to the moon, did I?”
        </p>




        <p>“That’s true, but if you wanted to stop them you had more than enough chances to do so. Yet you didn’t. The
          heart of the rocket’s power is Reimu’s ability, but that’s because you made Reimu train. On top of that you
          brought the topic up to the vampire and even gave them all that time. During all that time you just watched
          them. Knowing this, how can one say that you didn’t want them to go to the moon?"
        </p>




        <p>“...That crescent of the mikazuki is said to be a sword. Seeing that sharp look, it is very understandable.
          Wouldn't it be seen as sophisticated to shoot a bullet at a sword-shaped moon?”
        </p>




        <p>In the lunar capital, there is one that can wield the sword of the gods. On Earth, there is one that can
          shoot the bullet of the gods. It’s as simple as that.
        </p>




        <p>“Ran, you only need to listen to my orders. On the night of the full moon we will go to the moon through its
          reflection on this lake. Do not be negligent in your preparations.”
        </p>









        <p>-The night of the half moon.
        </p>




        <p>Snow fluttered to the ground. The weather was not optimal tonight, but by the time of the full moon it would
          surely be clear.
        </p>




        <p>The moon had changed from a sword to a bow. The half moon was also called the “yumihari-zuki” for its bow-like shape.
        </p>




        <p>When it was a sword the weather had been fine, but unfortunately the bow was not visible. Are there none who
          wield a bow on the moon?
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari. It’s cold, so why not go back to the mansion? It seems the moon is not visible tonight anyway.”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh, but moon-watching is so much more fun when there is no moon. Maybe the bow-shaped moon is hidden in the
          basement of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.”
        </p>




        <p>“Really? Anyway, the orbital period that we were talking about the other day-”
        </p>




        <p>Ran changed topics. If she let me talk a bit more maybe she would’ve understood it.[8]</a></sup>
        </p>




        <p>“It seems that it is highly likely that the orbital period was changed.”
        </p>




        <p>“What do you mean by that?”
        </p>




        <p>"Originally, the moon was meant to undergo a full rotation in exactly twenty-eight days. But the strange
          rotation period slightly interfered with the orbital period."
        </p>




        <p>Ran started to explain the properties of gravity as it works on a rotating planet. The moon changes itself to
          an oval shape due to Earth’s gravity and its own gravity’s work. That slight change in shape changes the
          gravity that works on it and accelerates the orbital period. When the rotation period is shorter than the
          orbital period, it slows its rotation period, and when the rotation period is longer, it speeds up the
          rotation period.
        </p>




        <p>Ran explained the work of gravity on two points using actual numbers.
        </p>




        <p>“For such reasons, there is a high possibility that someone tampered with the rotation period and slowed down
          its orbital period. When its rate is changed by two thirds of a day, it is not within the usual margin of
          error."
        </p>




        <p>“And your conclusion?”
        </p>




        <p>"The only reason why one would do such a thing is to constantly observe the Earth by facing the same side
          towards it while removing days when it would be completely opposite.*1 In this way, one would be able to
          observe the Earth throughout the entire year... though, this would be quite some time ago."
        </p>




        <p>When it comes to simple calculations, there would be nothing that can rival a shikigami. But in the outside
          world the calculation of gravity is said to be very difficult when there are more than three points affecting
          it. The calculation of gravity is said to be a trial even with the shikigami of today.
        </p>




        <p>But in reality, it is not the shikigami themselves, but the programs of these shikigami that cannot process
          it. If one orders a shikigami, it will always give an answer with simple calculation methods.
        </p>




        <p>Needless to say, what I wanted was not something so boring.
        </p>




        <p>“Ah, thank you. But that's one of the faults of shikigami, isn't it?"
        </p>




        <p>“Excuse me?”
        </p>




        <p>“You get an answer instantly.”
        </p>




        <p>“That’s true. I thought you wanted me to research something else, but unfortunately I’m a shikigami and can
          only do things under your command.”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh, you're depressing me and the vampire is going to the moon. How entirely dull.”
        </p>




        <p>“...It’s about a week until a full moon, and there’s nobody who will lend us their hand.”
        </p>




        <p>“You're making it sound as if people don’t like me, but there are several who are willing to help out. About
          seven, eight... perhaps nine will, just counting who immediately comes to mind.”
        </p>




        <p>“That many? Hmm... I wonder if something happened without me knowing?”
        </p>




        <p>“You can do calculations on astronomical levels and yet it seems like you can’t add single digits.”
        </p>









        <p>The day before the full moon.
        </p>




        <p><img
          src="./CH5_03.JPG"
          class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide"
        />A moon that was almost as big as a full moon had risen in the night sky. Although on Earth the moon is very
          bright, on a full moon it means that night falls on the backside of the moon. Around now it's probably dusk on
          the moon's backside.
        </p>




        <p>“Our second trip to the moon is, at long last, tomorrow.”
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari, although I trust you I can’t help but be worried when I know nothing about the current plans.
          Shall you inform me of the plans once we’re there?”
        </p>




        <p>“Mhmhm, I guess I should inspect
          the orders I gave you.”
        </p>




        <p>“That would be helpful. But it seems so different from the last time you made an attack on the moon. I hear
          that in the past you gathered an army of the strongest youkai around and they were full of zeal and
          enthusiasm. Even then you were not victorious yet this time... excuse me for the way I say this... but it
          seems very lax. We lack numbers, we have no plan and, forgive me for saying, but I doubt you’re going to have
          any chance against them.”
        </p>




        <p>“I’ll tell you one very important thing.”
        </p>




        <p>I looked at the moon with its slightly dull edge. When that bit becomes lit the moon will be accessible from
          the Earth. It was not long ago that this became possible, only about a thousand years ago.
        </p>




        <p>“The residents of Earth can never beat the residents of the moon.”
        </p>




        <p>Ran had a puzzled look on her face.
        </p>




        <p>“Huh? We can never beat...?”
        </p>




        <p>“The Lunarians possess highly advanced technology, unyielding stamina and abilities that are far outmatch
          those of youkai. The ones living on Earth can never beat those on the moon, especially in the lunar capital.”
        </p>




        <p>“Th-Then why have you, now of all times, decided to attack the moon!? It’s unreasonable, you really don’t
          believe what you just said, right?”
        </p>




        <p>“No, I really do not think that we stand a chance against them.”
        </p>




        <p>“...Then what are we doing tomorrow?”
        </p>




        <p>“A new resident of Gensokyo has arrived from the moon. We must receive something in return. Residential tax,
          so to speak.”
        </p>




        <p>“Excuse me? What do you mean by that?”
        </p>




        <p>Gensokyo is full of inhabitants that do as they like, but such freedom is not something that is promised. For
          everybody to live their lives with the least bit of freedom there needs to be a certain extent of rule. That
          rule will create a certain extent of hindrance to freedom, but that hindrance is necessary for freedom.
        </p>




        <p>For example, humans of Gensokyo are constantly under the threat of being attacked by youkai, but they need to
          live with that threat to live in Gensokyo.
        </p>




        <p>Youkai need to attack people because if they don’t do so, their very existence will be at risk, so youkai
          will attack humans.
        </p>




        <p>The lives of those who live in Gensokyo are maintained by the youkai. If there were no youkai in Gensokyo,
          Gensokyo would collapse. Thus, humans will not forget the fear that they have for the youkai and yet will not
          exterminate the youkai that might attack them, since doing so would destroy Gensokyo.
        </p>




        <p>The opposite is also true, and if youkai didn’t have any humans to attack, the youkai would lose the meaning
          of their existence. Thus, youkai may attack humans but do not eat them recklessly. Humans from the town are
          generally not for their eating under the contract.
        </p>




        <p>“The new residents that are from the moon chose to live as human and not as youkai. Thus the ones at Eientei
          chose to be humans.”
        </p>




        <p>I added “save that rabbit” at the end, as that was not able to become human no matter how hard it tried.
        </p>




        <p>“Human...? That clan of aliens? ...Umm, I cannot see them as humans no matter how hard I try...”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh, but it’s not a matter of looks. They do not follow the rule of youkai and are trying to enter human
          society, are they not?”
        </p>




        <p>They sell medicine and look after the sick. Such actions are “work” in human society and differ from those in
          youkai society.
        </p>




        <p>“True, they have not adapted with youkai like us. The people of the town seem to think of them as strange
          humans, though...”
        </p>




        <p>“Yet they do not fulfill the role of humans.”
        </p>




        <p>The humans in the outside world have roles they must fulfill, too: learning, working and being a part of
          society, including paying taxes. Gensokyo then adds dealing with youkai to the list.
        </p>




        <p>“The roles of humans, you say? Come to think about it, that’s right. They do not fear youkai, and their
          existence can destroy the power balance between the humans and the youkai. ...But what does that have to do
          with the invasion of the moon?”
        </p>




        <p>“I already told you that, didn’t I? I want residential tax. Even if it does strengthen the humans to the
          extent of healing and caring for their wounds, I don’t mind. But they are not fulfilling their roles in paying
          tax, and thus cannot be a part of human society.
        </p>




        <p>“...Then do you plan to steal something from the capital as tax payment, because they are immigrants from the
          moon?”
        </p>




        <p>Ran asked as if she realized the answer as she said it. I was content because my answer was understood for
          once.
        </p>




        <p>“Yes, that’s the idea. It would be impossible to invade the lunar capital, but wouldn't it be easy enough to
          sneak in? I would like you to carry out that task.”
        </p>









        <p>-The long awaited night of the full moon finally came.
        </p>




        <p><img

          class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide"
        />The cresent moon a sword, the half moon a bow. What can the full moon be called?
        </p>




        <p>A mirror.
        </p>




        <p>A large mirror that reflects the sunlight, and at the same time illuminates the darkness of the Earth. The
          most light comes from the full moon. While it may seem as if it were the worst night for youkai, why is it
          that they are the most powerful under the light of the moon?
        </p>




        <p>The reason for that is because the light not only illuminates, but gives rise to shadows as well.
        </p>




        <p>Under the dim light of the moon, all sorts of things blanket the Earth in shadows, such as grasses, trees,
          mountains, rocks and buildings. With light as weak as moonlight, it is impossible to eliminate these shadows.
          And they are the birthplace of humanity's fears, sometimes creating legends of youkai. In a manner of
          speaking, the moon gave birth to all youkai.
        </p>




        <p>I gazed at the moon's reflection on the lake. It appeared to be floating on something rather than hanging in
          the sky. Thinking of it that way, the moon in the sky seemed as if it was just a picture.
        </p>




        <p>As I was sitting on the surface of the lake, Ran came to my side.
        </p>




        <p>“It seems that the sun has set completely.”
        </p>




        <p>“You’re late. I almost thought you weren’t coming until the break of dawn.”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh no, it is still merely nightfall. The night is only beginning.”
        </p>




        <p>The reflection of the moon was a tangible illusion. The far-off moon in the sky was a picture on the roof of
          the heavens. They were essentialy the same.
        </p>




        <p>I modified the borders of the illusionary moon and its picture to create a passage between Earth and the
          moon.
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari, hasn't the vampire's rocket reached the moon by now?”
        </p>




        <p>“They must surely be causing a racket, then. Perhaps they are even learning a very good lesson around now.”
        </p>




        <p>“So the vampire was just a diversion?”
        </p>




        <p>“Well... I suppose you would not be mistaken in believing that.”
        </p>




        <p>“?”
        </p>




        <p>I closed my umbrella and thrust it into the illusionary moon floating on the lake. The umbrella remained
          standing on the water and showed no signs of sinking.
        </p>




        <p>The moon on the surface of the lake wavered and, after a brief contraction, expanded. By the time the moon
          reached its maximum size, it began to break apart from the point where the umbrella had been stabbed into it.
        </p>




        <p>The cracks in the center of the moon became several centimeters thick. As the moon broke apart on the water,
          an opening to another place was starting to appear. A crisp scent wafted from the other side.
        </p>




        <p>On the other side of this crack was the surface of the moon, where the vampire and the others had already
          arrived. By entering this fissure one could instantaneously arrive on the moon.
        </p>




        <p>They had spent months to create their shabby rocket and spent more than ten days in a miserable, cramped
          space to go to the moon.
        </p>




        <p>It was idiotic. If all that is needed to go to the moon, it is possible to do so in an instant. This is
          Gensokyo; one need not imitate the magic of the outside world here.
        </p>




        <p>But I already knew that the vampire and her cohorts would not agree with my plan.
        </p>




        <p>Those vampires have the spirit that I've forgotten. The feeling that the humans outside have begun to forget
          about and the feeling that shikigami whose thoughts centered around efficiency despised.
        </p>




        <p>-The fun that would come from travelling in a miserable, shabby rocket. Anything gained through the shortest
          method has no meaning to it. It was the spirit of enjoying hard work.
        </p>




        <p>Long-living humans and youkai often forgot that mindset, but that vampire and the others still had a powerful
          desire for it. That was why they neglected to go to the moon using my powers and insisted on going to the moon
          by their own hand.
        </p>









        <p>"It's almost time. Finally, the time to begin the counterattack the Lunarians."
        </p>




        <p>“Indeed. However, Ran, before we say goodbye to Earth, I’ll give you a hint of what to do once we get there.”
        </p>




        <p>“A hint? If you could order me, I would be much more grateful.”
        </p>




        <p>“Even if it was an order, it's more fun to think about it by one's self, right?”
        </p>




        <p>“Well, I suppose.”
        </p>




        <p>“We spoke about the orbital period a few days ago. The orbital period is shorter than was expected. I’ll tell
          you the reason for that.”
        </p>




        <p>“That’s very interesting... but that’s the hint?”
        </p>




        <p>“The reason why the moon’s orbital period is shorter than twenty-eight days is because that is the mousetrap
          that was set a long, long time ago.”
        </p>




        <p>“?”
        </p>




        <p>“Here is a hypothetical situation. Let’s say there was a youkai that was able to connect the Earth and the
          moon using the full moon.”
        </p>




        <p>“That would be you, correct?”
        </p>




        <p>“I said it was hypothetical. Naturally, this youkai who knew that she could easily make such a pathway
          thought about sneaking into the Lunar Capital for sport.”
        </p>




        <p>The pathway at our feet was just about big enough for a person to pass through. I jumped into the pathway and
          the first thing to come was the blinding light of the daytime moon. I could see a sky full of stars and an
          endlessly expansive body of water. It was the sea of the moon.
        </p>




        <p>Ran arrived after I did.
        </p>




        <p>We would come here every month, so Ran wasn’t surprised. From here, I kept watch over the state on Earth by
          turning a crow into a shikigami. Needless to say, I was mimicking the doings of the Lunarians.
        </p>









        <p>“...That youkai opened a path to the moon through the heavens on the fifteenth night, and decided to sneak
          in. ...But this is still a hypothetical situation.”
        </p>




        <p>“Right.”
        </p>




        <p>“There was little information about the Lunar Capital and one couldn’t start without going there first. The
          long awaited fifteenth night had come and that youkai jumped into the moon on the lake surface... What do you
          think she saw there?”
        </p>




        <p>“A sea as far as the eye can see?”
        </p>




        <p>“Correct, well done. The moon was covered with a very beautiful sea and the youkai knew instantaneously that
          the way back would be to go through the planet that was reflected on its surface.”
        </p>




        <p>I jammed my umbrella into the cracks that we just took so it wouldn’t close, and bent the umbrella into the
          way that we would take from here. The umbrella took on a deformed shape after being bent a few times.
        </p>




        <p>“Lady Yukari, what are you doing by bending your umbrella like that...?”
        </p>




        <p><img
          src="./CH5_05.JPG"
          class="imageSizesOnTextLeftSide"
        />“A secret. It’s like a good luck charm. Anyway, back to my hypothetical situation. After preparing a way
          back, the youkai felt assured and traveled to the Lunar Capital.”
        </p>




        <p>“And this is still... hypothetical, correct?”
        </p>




        <p>“I don't like to repeat myself too many times. That youkai looked for a way to break the barrier that
          surrounds the Lunar Capital. The barrier was more complex than she expected and would take her a long time.”
        </p>




        <p>I started on the way towards the moon’s capital. Ran hurriedly followed.
        </p>




        <p>“Finally, finding a key to breaking the barrier, the youkai tried to enter the capital. However, the capital
          was well protected and the youkai came to the conclusion that she didn’t have enough power at the moment, or
          it would take too much time. The smart youkai thought to retreat for the moment being and think of a plan.”
        </p>




        <p>“...”
        </p>




        <p>“Easily brushing off the Lunarian pursuers, the youkai made her way back to the path that she'd taken to come
          to the moon. Only to be shocked at what she saw.”
        </p>




        <p>Ran remained silent. She was probably too wrapped up in my story.
        </p>




        <p>“The path had slowly started to close and was no longer a size that the youkai could go through. The youkai
          was shocked, 'Why was the pathway closing? If it is the fifteenth night there should be no way that it would
          close.'”
        </p>




        <p>“And then what happened? Oh, I mean, what happened in the hypothetical situation?”
        </p>




        <p>“The youkai who had no way to return had to surrender. Since she was up against those that she could not
          defeat.”
        </p>




        <p>“I-Is that so... Um, and why did that hypothetical situation end so poorly?
        </p>




        <p>“What are you saying? The question was why the moon’s orbital period is not twenty-eight days, but
          twenty-seven and a third of a day. Correct?”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh, right.”
        </p>




        <p>“By telling you that much, you should understand, right? The fifteenth night used to be a perfect full moon,
          but by somebody’s doing, probably a Lunarian sage, the rotational period was changed and orbital period was
          altered. Before you knew it the fifteenth night was no longer a night of the perfect full moon. Thus the full
          moon would close quicker than expected.”
        </p>




        <p>“So what you’re saying is that it was a trap that a Lunarian sage thought of to trap the youkai that would
          find its way into the moon using the full moon?”
        </p>




        <p>“Exactly, a trap that was set for a very long time by the much-despised Lunarian sage.”
        </p>




        <p>It was from that time that one could not make a month thirty days and Earth’s calendar was in confusion. The
          Lunarians did not care about how the Earth would be affected, only about not letting the full moon exactly
          coincide with the fifteenth night, and altered the orbit of the moon. To those on the moon, Earth only existed
          to look down upon, so they never took their case into account.
        </p>









        <p>The sea of the moon was very quiet and only the slight sound of the waves could be heard. The sound of the
          waves was not of a sea filled with nature but only the sound made by the water molecules bumping into each
          other. That was because there was no life in the seas of the moon.
        </p>




        <p>“Although it was a hypothetical sitaution, it was very helpful. But thinking from the hint...”
        </p>




        <p>“What is it?”
        </p>




        <p>Ran seemed to be choosing her words carefully, not being able to respond. Although her calculation abilities
          were high, her language abilities might not be sufficient.
        </p>




        <p>“Wouldn’t... it mean that right now we’re right in the trap that the Lunarian sage had set? If it would take
          time to get to the Lunar Capital, by the time we come back it wouldn’t be a full moon any more. Not to mention
          breaking the barrier around the Capital itself would also take some time, right?”
        </p>




        <p>“Oh my, I didn’t notice that.”
        </p>




        <p>“No, please don’t joke around. We’re in enemy territory and the slightest of mistakes can lead to disaster.
          Of course I believe that you have some kind of plan...”
        </p>




        <p>“Well, if we no longer have a way back, we can ask for a ride on the vampire’s rocket. She should be on the
          moon by now. Or did we arrive first?”
        </p>




        <p>“Honestly, I can never tell when you are serious or not. That rocket might have fallen apart on impact with
          the sea for all we know. Although you probably never saw it, it was really a poorly built piece of junk.”
        </p>




        <p>Ran acted as if she was upset but she had to do exactly as I said so she had to trust me.
        </p>




        <p>“So, it was that poorly built? If so, it might have even burned up en route... unless it had a trick up its
          sleeve.”
        </p>




        <p>The moon was unthinkably silent compared to the Gensokyo that was constantly noisy from bickering between
          humans and youkai.
        </p>




        <p>Humans sought the bustle and glamour of urban life, and before they knew it, the Earth was rid of silence. If
          even Gensokyo being a rural area was noisy, the outside world was even more so.
        </p>




        <p>Yet the Lunar Capital was even more technologically advanced. That means this city on the other side of the
          moon should be very noisy. If they are living in peaceful prosperity, that would only be a sign of decay. Or
          perhaps it could mean an incomparably advanced civilization.
        </p>









        <p>Whether it was decay or pure heaven, I hated it. I needed the noise of the city.
        </p>

        <p>With that in mind, thinking that the vampire and the others were somewhere on this quiet moon causing a
          racket made me feel nostalgic.
