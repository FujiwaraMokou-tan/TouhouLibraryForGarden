          <p>
            Recently, we have often heard of the Netherworld when it comes to
            sightseeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that the border of the Netherworld somehow became thinner,
            it&#39;s easy to enter even if alive. Originally, one could only go
            there after they had died.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering, one would be surprised to see a quiet and
            considerably large garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears hazy off in the distance, and no matter how fast one
            flies over it, it&#39;s imposisble to see the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second surprise coming from the fact that the garden belongs to
            just one mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mansion with this considerably large garden standing in the
            Netherworld is called Hakugyokurou, which is a Japanese mansion
            slightly mixed with the atmosphere of other countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the mansion is rather large, but there&#39;s no denying that
            it&#39;s smaller than the length of the garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beautiful cherry blossoms can be seen in the garden of Hakugyokurou.
            It could even be called a sea of cherry blossoms, the likes of which
            cannot be seen in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plenty of ghosts and youkai attracted by these beautiful flowers
            visit here every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, living humans also have learn of its existence at last.
            That&#39;s why flower-viewing parties are held for living and dead
            beings at Hakugyokurou.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&#39;s not certain how long the border will stay so thin, so I
            recommend visiting as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also took part in the party and I saw a exciting scene: a huge
            number of ghosts and the Three Prismriver Sisters live in concert.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought the Netherworld was a quiet place, so I was surprised how
            different my impression was from reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, humans will be able to live merrily like this in the
            world after death, so they should live their lives to the fullest
            while they&#39;re alive, I think.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to live a happy lifestyle in the Netherworld, they must
            work hard without commiting suicide so they don&#39;t to go to Hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way of thinking, humans appear to be both hardworking and
            adorable beings.
