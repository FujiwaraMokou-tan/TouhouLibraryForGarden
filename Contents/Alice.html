				<p>On X the Xth, a great quantity of human-shaped dolls made from straw were found
					nailed to trees behind the shrine.</p>
				<p>The act of affixing human-shaped dolls to trees where others can't see
					them is an ancient ritual.</p>
				<p>It was a surprise to see this still being practiced in modern times.</p>
				<p>However, calling them mere dolls is not an accurate depiction of their
					craftsmanship. They were practically works of art.</p>
				<p>I wanted to learn more about the craftsman bringing this ancient tradition
					into the present.</p>
				<p>Since I first had to ascertain their identity, I conducted a stakeout
					over the area behind the shrine.</p>
				<p>After three days, the dollmaker Alice Margatroid (magician) finally appeared.</p>
				<p>Ms. Margatroid was happy to give me a brief statement despite her surprise.</p>
				<p>These straw effigies are a type of doll.</p>
				<p>You can't cut any corners while making them.</p>
				<p>So, when do you think their finest moment is?</p>
				<p>It goes without saying that it's when they're nailed to a tree.</p>
				<p>That's why I secretly come here to put them up.</p>
				<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Still-Living Tradition and The Artisan</span>
				<div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
				<p>The artisan began affixing the figures to the trees using nails.</p>
				<p>This time, I tried to ask why she decided to use such relatively minor
					traditional artform such as straw figures.</p>
				<p>Obviously, because they say if you make one according to certain rules,
					you can place a curse on someone's soul.</p>
				<p>I believe that led to the creation of the doll.</p>
				<p>People ask why dolls are in the form of humans. I believe it's because
					it allows for a mystical connection to a subject.</p>
				<p>If you pierce the effigy with a nail, the subject will feel pain as
					well.</p>
				<p>If I can understand this dynamic better, I believe I can come a step
					closer to my goal of creating an independently moving doll.</p>
				<p>That's why I'm creating these straw figures.</p>
				<p>Oh, it's not like I have a grudge on anyone, honestly.</p>
				<p>And so the artist began hammering the dolls again.</p>
				<p>Though she said it was only for research, she returned to her performance
					so vigorously and with such a terrifying expression that I decided not to
					bother her any further and ended my questioning.</p>
				<p>Traditional crafts such as this are lost as the ages pass.</p>
				<p>The only ones who can preserve them are not the humans, who try to hide
					them, but youkai.</p>
				<p>This is because it's easier for youkai, who often live alone for long
					periods of time, to leave remnants of the past as they were in olden days
					than it is for the humans, whose society can change in the blink of an eye.</p>
				<p>To all youkai living today, perhaps it would be best not only to keep
					an eye on the future, but to occasionally stop and turn to examine the past.</p>

				</p>
				<p>Oh, no. You saw me?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>I did, and I even interviewed you.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>It really won't work if I'm seen nailing the dolls to the trees. And
					I went to all that work picking just the right place and time.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>I had been hiding for three days.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>So that's why the effects were so weak...</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>The... effects?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Oh, nothing. So, what did you come for today?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>There were some things I didn't have the chance to ask you, so I thought
					I'd come and write an article about your workshop while I was at it. I'd
					really appreciate it.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>My workshop? Well, I suppose. I've been meaning to do some cleaning,
					so be careful on your way in.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>...You certainly have a lot of dolls. Did you make them all yourself?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Well, not all of them, I think, but most of them are my work.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>I think I asked you something similar the other day, but the dolls you
					have here look much more like your subjects than the straw ones, don't they?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Well, it's not just about how close the likeness is to the original.
					For example, if I made a doll of you and did something to it, then I've
					just done something to a doll, right? But what if it was to a piece of paper
					with your name on it? It's indirect, but doesn't that signify you, instead?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>I see, so in other words, when you use straw dolls, it's like you're
					not pounding nails into the dolls, but into the person the dolls represent.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Well, a piece of paper with somebody's name on it isn't as useful as
					if you've got a bit of their hair, or something like that. But you know,
					it's really not like I'm holding a grudge against anyone.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>Just who were those dolls of?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Let's go onto the next question now.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>Okay, okay, I understand, so please put down that hammer and those nails.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>So, where were we?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>W-Well, let's see... Can you please tell us about your stated goal about
					an independently moving doll?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span> </p>
				<p>I'm sure I've seen something like that, a long time ago. An independently
					moving and thinking doll. I've poured my soul into making one, but I've
					never been successful. I mean, it's easy enough to make a doll that will
					do something if I command it to, but beyond that... there's just so much
					more I need to learn.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>Have you really seen such a thing as a doll that thinks and moves on
					its own?</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice</span>
				</p>
				<p>Who made it, and how? It certainly appeared to be moving by its own devices.
					In any case, I'll have to continue my research until I succeed. It looks
					like it'll be a long road.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
				</p>
				<p>Thank you for your time and cooperation. </p>
