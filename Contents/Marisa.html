		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: left;" alt="" src="018Marisa.JPG" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20" />On 
		the day of X the Xth at about half past noon, another burglary occurred 
		at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, located by the edge of the lake.</p>
		<p>Ever since the Red Mist Incident (*1) last month, there has been a surprising 
		number of successive break-ins; not even a month has elapsed since the incident 
		and yet more than ten break-ins have occurred.</p>
		<p>Our newspaper, as a result of a three-day stakeout, managed to obtain 
		photographs of a burglary in progress.</p>
		<p>Regrettably, the crime could not be stopped, because the journalist in 
		charge was completely devoted to photography.</p>
		<p>The criminal appears to be Marisa Kirisame (human), who lives in an unkempt 
		house in the Forest of Magic.</p>
		<p>When the victims of these crimes, the residents of the mansion, were 
		questioned, they were evasive in their reply. &quot;But we already know who the 
		culprit is.&quot;</p>
		<p>It wouldn&#39;t be unreasonable to think that there&#39;s some relationship between 
		this and the earlier Red Mist Incident.</p>
		<p>The crime was very simple: after casually sneaking in through the back 
		entrance, the criminal acted as if she owned the place, and walked about 
		inside the mansion. She then left with whatever books she felt like taking.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that the palatial Scarlet Devil Mansion would ever 
		be completely unoccupied. I couldn&#39;t help thinking that they must have slackened 
		their security to allow these thefts to happen while surely somebody was 
		present.</p>
		<p>In that case, since the mansion wasn&#39;t empty, it might not be accurate 
		to call it a burglary.</p>
		<p>However, it seemed to be neither mugging nor swindling, so it seems to 
		be the most appropriate name.</p>
		<p>For that reason, this article has settled on the term burglary.</p>
		<p>According to the resident who was robbed, the criminal left the following 
		words.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Me, burglar? That&#39;s just mean. Just &#39;cause I snuck 
		in didn&#39;t mean I stole anything. My life is way shorter than yours anyway, 
		so can&#39;t you just take back everything after I kick the bucket? I&#39;m just 
		borrowing until then. It should be good for the stuff I&#39;m taking that way, 
		too.&quot; </p>
		<p>The contents of the excerpt are very human-like and childish, but it 
		is more surprising that the culprit and the residents regularly converse.</p>

&nbsp; <small>&nbsp; *1 This summer, a red mist temporarily engulfed Gensokyo, blocking 
		all sunlight.<br>
		The details are uncertain, but it is known that last month, the incident 
		was resolved by a human and the strong sunlight of summer was restored.

		<p>What is this third-rate rag?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>It&#39;s the &quot;Bunbunmaru Newspaper&quot;, reporting the most wonderful information 
		with the fastest speed in Gensokyo. I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s anyone who hasn&#39;t 
		heard of it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Yep, third-rate. The inside is just awful. What kinda idiot would write 
		stuff like this?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Sometimes overly accurate information is criticized.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Yer the idiot who wrote this, aren&#39;tcha?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>Even if I am criticized, I shall not stop writing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There’s nothin&#39; more annoying than an active idiot. &#39;Sides, you said 
		it’s the fastest in Gensokyo, but when did this story here happen?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>Since it was around the same time as the Red Mist Incident... I guess 
		it&#39;s only 20 years ago? Or maybe it was 12?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>It was two years ago. Yer internal clock is what&#39;s fast here. What’s 
		the point in writin&#39; &#39;bout ancient history?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>This newspaper itself was published two years ago. You saw my camera 
		and said, &quot;I wanna see an article with my picture in it.&quot; That&#39;s why I found 
		it for you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Ah, Guess that does sound like me, all right. Don&#39;t really see many workin&#39; 
		cameras in Gensokyo... Hey, waitaminit! You wrote an article about me without 
		askin&#39; permission, and you didn&#39;t tell me about it fer two years?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>My duty is to report the true form of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Yer sure one sly crow, huh. Wonder where you’ve been hidin&#39;...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>We tengu have always been watching all of Gensokyo from the sky and we 
		can hear gossip on the wind. No matter where you commit a crime, you can&#39;t 
		keep it a secret!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>You mean you tengu have super-powered eyes and ears, and nothin&#39; better 
		to do. Can ya smell as well as dogs?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>No comment.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Come to think of it, there was a rumor that when we have a feast outside 
		fulla good food and drink, your friends will come out of nowhere and join 
		in. So yeah, about as good as dogs?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>That’s a baseless rumor. You shouldn&#39;t spread rumors like that!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Oh, ya don&#39;t say? Still, considerin&#39; the article hasn&#39;t been criticized 
		for two years, it don&#39;t look like ya got too many subscribers.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>I&#39;ve got to popularize my newspaper more.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>I think your paper&#39;s quality matches its popularity. By the way, I heard 
		I could get sake, detergent and amulets by readin&#39; a newspaper in the outside 
		world. How about yours?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>No, you cannot.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>I think at least sake would be good.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>I said no. The &quot;Bunbunmaru Newspaper&quot; gives top priority to its contents.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>Too bad the articles aren&#39;t that good. Still, I&#39;ll take this one, since 
		it&#39;s a pretty good shot of me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>No, this one is for my archives! I can&#39;t just give it away!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marisa</span></p>
		<p>I&#39;m just borrowin&#39; it &#39;til I kick the bucket.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span></p>
		<p>You really seem like a human who&#39;ll live for a long time.</p>
