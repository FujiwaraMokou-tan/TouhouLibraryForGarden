            />On the day of X the Xth at about half past noon, another burglary
            occurred at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, located by the edge of the
            lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since the Red Mist Incident (*1) last month, there has been a
            surprising number of successive break-ins; not even a month has
            elapsed since the incident and yet more than ten break-ins have
            occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our newspaper, as a result of a three-day stakeout, managed to
            obtain photographs of a burglary in progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regrettably, the crime could not be stopped, because the journalist
            in charge was completely devoted to photography.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal appears to be Marisa Kirisame (human), who lives in an
            unkempt house in the Forest of Magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the victims of these crimes, the residents of the mansion, were
            questioned, they were evasive in their reply. But we already know
            who the culprit is.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wouldn't be unreasonable to think that there's some relationship
            between this and the earlier Red Mist Incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crime was very simple: after casually sneaking in through the
            back entrance, the criminal acted as if she owned the place, and
            walked about inside the mansion. She then left with whatever books
            she felt like taking.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's hard to believe that the palatial Scarlet Devil Mansion would
            ever be completely unoccupied. I couldn't help thinking that they
            must have slackened their security to allow these thefts to happen
            while surely somebody was present.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that case, since the mansion wasn't empty, it might not be
            accurate to call it a burglary.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it seemed to be neither mugging nor swindling, so it seems
            to be the most appropriate name.
          </p>
          <p>For that reason, this article has settled on the term burglary.</p>
          <p>
            According to the resident who was robbed, the criminal left the
            following words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Me, burglar? That's just mean. Just 'cause I snuck in didn't mean I
            stole anything. My life is way shorter than yours anyway, so can't
            you just take back everything after I kick the bucket? I'm just
            borrowing until then. It should be good for the stuff I'm taking
            that way, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contents of the excerpt are very human-like and childish, but it
            is more surprising that the culprit and the residents regularly
            converse.

            *1 This summer, a red mist temporarily engulfed Gensokyo, blocking
            all sunlight.
            <div class="divLineBreakerSubTitles"></div>
            The details are uncertain, but it is known that last month, the
            incident was resolved by a human and the strong sunlight of summer
            was restored.

          <p>What is this third-rate rag?</p>

          <p>
            It's the Bunbunmaru Newspaper, reporting the most wonderful
            information with the fastest speed in Gensokyo. I can't believe
            there's anyone who hasn't heard of it.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Yep, third-rate. The inside is just awful. What kinda idiot would
            write stuff like this?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Sometimes overly accurate information is criticized.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>Yer the idiot who wrote this, aren'tcha?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>Even if I am criticized, I shall not stop writing.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s nothin' more annoying than an active idiot. 'Sides, you said
            it’s the fastest in Gensokyo, but when did this story here happen?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            Since it was around the same time as the Red Mist Incident... I
            guess it's only 20 years ago? Or maybe it was 12?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            It was two years ago. Yer internal clock is what's fast here. What’s
            the point in writin' 'bout ancient history?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            This newspaper itself was published two years ago. You saw my camera
            and said, I wanna see an article with my picture in it. That's why I
            found it for you.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            Ah, Guess that does sound like me, all right. Don't really see many
            workin' cameras in Gensokyo... Hey, waitaminit! You wrote an article
            about me without askin' permission, and you didn't tell me about it
            fer two years?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>My duty is to report the true form of Gensokyo.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>Yer sure one sly crow, huh. Wonder where you’ve been hidin'...</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            We tengu have always been watching all of Gensokyo from the sky and
            we can hear gossip on the wind. No matter where you commit a crime,
            you can't keep it a secret!
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            You mean you tengu have super-powered eyes and ears, and nothin'
            better to do. Can ya smell as well as dogs?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>No comment.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            Come to think of it, there was a rumor that when we have a feast
            outside fulla good food and drink, your friends will come out of
            nowhere and join in. So yeah, about as good as dogs?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>That’s a baseless rumor. You shouldn't spread rumors like that!</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            Oh, ya don't say? Still, considerin' the article hasn't been
            criticized for two years, it don't look like ya got too many
            subscribers.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>I've got to popularize my newspaper more.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            I think your paper's quality matches its popularity. By the way, I
            heard I could get sake, detergent and amulets by readin' a newspaper
            in the outside world. How about yours?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>No, you cannot.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>I think at least sake would be good.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            I said no. The Bunbunmaru Newspaper gives top priority to its
            contents.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>
            Too bad the articles aren't that good. Still, I'll take this one,
            since it's a pretty good shot of me.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>No, this one is for my archives! I can't just give it away!</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Marisa</span></p>
          <p>I'm just borrowin' it 'til I kick the bucket.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>You really seem like a human who'll live for a long time.</p>
