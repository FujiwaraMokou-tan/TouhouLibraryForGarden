            >On the Xth of month X, at around 12PM, a prank-loving fairy was
            eaten by a giant toad. She somehow escaped, and her injuries were
            nothing major.
          </p>
          <p>The victim is an ice fairy, Cirno (fairy).</p>
          <p>
            It was said that she was enjoying herself by freezing frogs at a
            swamp, and was then discovered and eaten by a giant toad that could
            be considered the size of two humans.
          </p>
          <p>Since you reap what you sow, the giant toad bears no sin.</p>
          <p>
            Geez, why the heck was there a giant toad in such a small swamp?! If
            it wasn't me but someone else, they wouldn't have been able to get
            away.
          </p>
          <p>
            The instant the victim was devoured, she chilled the insides of the
            toad which surprised it enough to spit her out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The giant toad was the master of that small swamp, and after hearing
            that a fairy was freezing the frogs at its swamp, it decided to
            punish it.
          </p>
          <p>The fairy had this to say about playing by freezing frogs:</p>
          <p>
            If the frogs are instantly completely frozen, they won't die, and
            when the ice melts they'll go back to normal. This isn't playing,
            this is ice training. I'm definitely not doing it because frozen
            frogs are cute, or because their cries are annoying, or because it's
            exciting when juggling them because they might break.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fairies generally enjoy pranks, and there are many cases in which
            they receive severe punishment for such pranks.
          </p>
          <p>The victim fairy in this event can be considered one such case.</p>
          <p>
            However, pranks are things done to people with more power than
            oneself, even for fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if she is always bullied, I think that directing that revenge
            towards weak frogs is a little pathetic; how might you see this?

            The only things ever eaten by a giant toad would be... flies and

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Yes, flies. An insect that doesn't think about the annoyance they
            cause, flapping their wings so busily as they buzz around.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>I fly a lot more calmly!</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Oh, but I was talking about flies.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            A, anyway. Couldn't you have made a cooler article of me? Like, Ice
            Fairy Defeats Despicable Giant Toad!
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            When did you defeat it? I don't write lies, even if it makes money.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>I ain't gonna make you money!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Then all the more reason not to.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>But this article, it just makes me seem really lame...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>In reality, to a witness you would look extremely lame.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>At least make the article cool!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If you succeed in being eaten in a cool way, then I'll write it so
            for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Then change the normal frogs part to giant toads.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I refuse. If it bothers you so much why don't you go and defeat the
            giant toad?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I did have a good match! When I ran away I completely chilled its
            stomach, enough to cause more than stomach problems!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a direct testimony from the giant toad who said that it only
            surprised him and that no actual harm was done.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't even know what it feels like to have your eyeballs pushed
            in while you're being swallowed by a giant toad!
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I don't think anyone would want to know that feeling.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Freezing toads and bringing them back to life is high class art!
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It isn't useful at all.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>

            toad.

            As I was worn out and flying about, I saw you sticking your head out
            of a giant toad's mouth. You should consider yourself lucky that
            there was an article on you at all.
