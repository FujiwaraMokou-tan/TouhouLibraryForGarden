		the Xth of month X, at around 12PM, a prank-loving fairy was eaten by a 
		giant toad. She somehow escaped, and her injuries were nothing major.</p>
		<p>The victim is an ice fairy, Cirno (fairy).</p>
		<p>It was said that she was enjoying herself by freezing frogs at a swamp, 
		and was then discovered and eaten by a giant toad that could be considered 
		the size of two humans.</p>
		<p>Since you reap what you sow, the giant toad bears no sin.</p>
		<p>&quot;Geez, why the heck was there a giant toad in such a small swamp?! If 
		it wasn&#39;t me but someone else, they wouldn&#39;t have been able to get away.&quot;</p>
		<p>The instant the victim was devoured, she chilled the insides of the toad 
		which surprised it enough to spit her out.</p>
		<p>The giant toad was the master of that small swamp, and after hearing 
		that a fairy was freezing the frogs at its swamp, it decided to punish it.</p>
		<p>The fairy had this to say about playing by freezing frogs:</p>
		<p>&quot;If the frogs are instantly completely frozen, they won&#39;t die, and when 
		the ice melts they&#39;ll go back to normal. This isn&#39;t playing, this is ice 
		training. I&#39;m definitely not doing it because frozen frogs are cute, or 
		because their cries are annoying, or because it&#39;s exciting when juggling 
		them because they might break.&quot;</p>
		<p>Fairies generally enjoy pranks, and there are many cases in which they 
		receive severe punishment for such pranks.</p>
		<p>The victim fairy in this event can be considered one such case.</p>
		<p>However, pranks are things done to people with more power than oneself, 
		even for fairies.</p>
		<p>Even if she is always bullied, I think that directing that revenge towards 
		weak frogs is a little pathetic; how might you see this?</p>

		<p>What the heck is this!?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Gensokyo&#39;s most definite source of information delivered quickly, Bunbunmaru 
		Newspaper.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>No, not that, the content, I mean the content! This makes it seem like 
		I&#39;m at fault here!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The content was based on objective views.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Kiiiiii! You&#39;ve never been eaten by a giant toad, what do you know!?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The only things ever eaten by a giant toad would be... flies and you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Flies...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, flies. An insect that doesn&#39;t think about the annoyance they cause, 
		flapping their wings so busily as they buzz around.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I fly a lot more calmly!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, but I was talking about flies.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A, anyway. Couldn&#39;t you have made a cooler article of me? Like, &quot;Ice 
		Fairy Defeats Despicable Giant Toad!&quot;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When did you defeat it? I don&#39;t write lies, even if it makes money.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I ain&#39;t gonna make you money!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Then all the more reason not to.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But this article, it just makes me seem really lame...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>In reality, to a witness you would look extremely lame.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>At least make the article cool!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you succeed in being eaten in a cool way, then I&#39;ll write it so for 
		you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Then change the normal frogs part to giant toads.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I refuse. If it bothers you so much why don&#39;t you go and defeat the giant 
		toad?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I did have a good match! When I ran away I completely chilled its stomach, 
		enough to cause more than stomach problems!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I have a direct testimony from the giant toad who said that it only surprised 
		him and that no actual harm was done.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You don&#39;t even know what it feels like to have your eyeballs pushed in 
		while you&#39;re being swallowed by a giant toad!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I don&#39;t think anyone would want to know that feeling.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Freezing toads and bringing them back to life is high class art!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>It isn&#39;t useful at all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Screech!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re really just an underdog, or underfairy, that lost to a giant toad.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What are you trying to do by spreading that all over Gensokyo!? If you 
		stayed quiet about it nobody would known!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Now, now, they say rumors between humans and youkai only last 75 years. 
		I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be laughed at for too long time. [2]</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re the one that caused it!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I just tell everyone the truth of daily happenings in Gensokyo.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There should be more than enough fairies being punished in the first 
		place! Why only me!?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That day was really peaceful, and nothing else really happened then. 
		As I was worn out and flying about, I saw you sticking your head out of 
		a giant toad&#39;s mouth. You should consider yourself lucky that there was 
		an article on you at all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cirno</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m actually lucky then? Yay~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, lucky. </p>
