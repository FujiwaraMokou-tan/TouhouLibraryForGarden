		<p>To accompany this second serialized spin-off, and with the upcoming release 
		of &quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower View&quot;, the kannushi of fantasy, ZUN, will show 
		the inner workings of his mind and activities. The goal of this book was 
		to confront how ZUN has not talked about the game from a story or creative 
		stance, and to express the concept behind his new game &quot;PoFV&quot;.</p>
		<p>The power of the kannushi&#39;s kotodama shall now stimulate your imagination

		<img style="width: 300px; height: 339px; float: left;" alt="" src="163BAiJRMarisa.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">--Today, 
		we will be asking ZUN about the philosophy at the heart of his games. First, 
		may I ask how you felt the first time you played a game?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		In the cafe at my parent&#39;s house, when I was in kindergarden they placed 
		a table arcade machine there to lighten up the atmosphere. Because of that, 
		I was greatly interested in games, and during elementary school, the NES 
		came out and we bought one right away. When I got a new game, I&#39;d play them 
		with my friends for as long as we could. But normally I would go outside 
		and catch bugs too. I was a normal countryside kid after all.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--What game from back then left an impression 
		on you?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; left the biggest impression on me. Before then, games 
		didn&#39;t scroll, and there were still many games with black backgrounds. But 
		in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, if you went underground, there was an underground 
		world. If you went above the clouds, there was a world above the clouds. 
		All the different places you could go in itself surprised me, and every 
		time I went somewhere new, I was impressed.</p>
		<p>The next impact was from... &quot;Street Fighter 2&quot;. That game&#39;s impression 
		was almost like a second revolution. Everyone would play the game, so it 
		was a way to fight without physically hurting each other. The play control 
		was important too. I would put in up to 10,000 yen in a day sometimes. That 
		made my allowance disappear in a flash though. (lol)</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--In both of these games, what points about 
		the game&#39;s genre or nature were important?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		Those games were revolutionary because they had things like different systems 
		from games before them, creating new atmospheres within themselves. Later, 
		people would say stuff like &quot;That game engine was revolutionary&quot; or &quot;The 
		characters had a lot of appeal&quot;, but at the time, no one really thought 
		about the individual aspects because they were too busy playing. But that 
		wasn&#39;t really the case, it was just popular to say. The systems in those 
		games weren&#39;t just the pinnacle of all the games made up to that point, 
		there was also a decisive difference. I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call it 
		&quot;creating a new world&quot; -- it&#39;s a little different from the usual meaning 
		-- but they were called the new standard.</p>
		<p>Now to speak about my thoughts on game design, about establishing the 
		foundation for creating a world, and designing a new world for my works. 
		At the base of everything is the game world, and I structure the game&#39;s 
		genre and system upon that, from which the pictures and the music flows. 
		One can feel this establishment as they play the game, so I believe. That&#39;s 
		why the game&#39;s genre as it is called is not just one part of the game, but 
		if you get too obsessed about that, it will lose all meaning as a video 
		game and will only create anxiety.</p>
		<p>A lot of people say &quot;The true nature of a game is it&#39;s genre, and the 
		genre and the world it takes place in are different things.&quot; often, however, 
		I don&#39;t think that they are contradictory concepts, and that they should 
		be thought of as one. If you look at &quot;Xevious&quot; or &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, it is 
		obvious that even at that time, games weren&#39;t mere collections of symbols. 
		For example, the very first video game was only about bouncing a ball back 
		and forth, but that wasn&#39;t how it was originally played. It was called &quot;Tennis&quot;. 
		Just how the first game was based on &quot;Tennis&quot; that took place in &quot;The World&quot;, 
		that&#39;s what I consider when I make games.</p>
		<p>However, even with that theory, if it&#39;s not interesting, it probably 
		can&#39;t be considered a success. On the other hand, only focusing on the basics 
		isn&#39;t interesting either, so it is important to be able to connect both 
		aspects to make a fun game. As one gains experience, being able to adjust 
		to a game&#39;s genre or parts of its system is unmistakably engaging, and I 
		think that games without that spark are missing the point. Before it can 
		be played as a game, I think it is very important for my works to have its 
		own setting.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--Now, when you say &quot;creating a world&quot;, 
		that comes with very broad implications, so I imagine there will be many 
		different approaches to establishing a world.</span></p>
		<p><br>
		Please think of the quality of a created world and how well it is established 
		as different things. For example, take sci-fi worlds or retro worlds. How 
		well they are liked relates to the quality of how a world is established. 
		On the other side, how well the music and the backgrounds match the world, 
		how the game controls relating to the world, even up to entering a name 
		for a high score, those are aspects relating to the quality of a created 
		world.</p>
		<p>
		<img style="width: 300px; height: 300px; float: left;" alt="" src="164BAiJRMystia.png" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">The 
		way I see it, however you decide to establish a world, you need to decide 
		on the the design of the created world. During the establishment of a game, 
		particularly when making characters for the so-called world creation, people 
		make the mistake of saying &quot;This won&#39;t have any effect on the game&quot;, but 
		even among these people there are those who say &quot;Because this character 
		is in the game, I hate it.&quot; This claim is proof enough that even characters 
		can influence a game. But in cases where there is truly no connection, then 
		it never mattered how the game was established in the first place. This 
		means that the &quot;hate&quot; that is felt is proportional to how much influence 
		the aspect has on the game. However, I recognize that there were bad games 
		with well-designed worlds.</p>
		<p>In &quot;Battle Garegga&quot; (*1), there was a very charismatic last boss called 
		Black Heart. That is a good example of how a game&#39;s design can really make 
		a character appealing. Before his appearance, you would see a lot of evidence 
		of him commanding his army during the stages in the game. That was very 
		important.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--Is creating a world the same as giving 
		meaning to every individual element in the game?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		For that, I&#39;d like to talk about Cave, who have always done a great job 
		in creating their worlds. In &quot;Progear&quot; (*2), the look of the game changes 
		as time passes from morning to evening, then to night, and when you start 
		the second loop, it&#39;s morning again. A simple thing like the flow of time 
		gives a real feeling of &quot;progression&quot;. There is a similar effect in &quot;Guwange&quot; 
		(*3), where it goes from the white color scheme in the town, to the darkness 
		of Hell at the end. The stages flow smoothly, and in addition, it starts 
		out in summer, and goes to fall, winter, and spring. The look of the game&#39;s 
		stages have meaning. In games made like this, the player gets absorbed into 
		the game world.</p>
		<p>In &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; too, even though it seems like the most attention 
		was given to what genre it was because it was popular, I think that the 
		world inside it was very good too. The fact is, I was influenced by &quot;Darius 
		Gaiden&quot; when I made the Touhou games.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--Can you give any specific examples of 
		this influence?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		In &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot;, there would be boss battles as long as 2/3rds of the 
		stage, and the bosses would have personalities. Another characteristic is 
		that the game would be organized solely to keep things exciting during the 
		middle. Until then, when talking about games, people would only say things 
		like &quot;Stage 3 was fun, Stage 4 was...&quot;, but in &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot;, there was 
		Octopus, and Greatthing, and people could call bosses by name when they 
		talked about the game. It meant that these game symbols were becoming something 
		else. This &quot;change&quot; of turning symbols into characters made its way into 
		Touhou too. So, the first point of influence is making the games to heavily 
		favor boss battles, the second is the shooting aspect, with the &quot;Spellcard&quot; 
		danmaku attack system, and the third is the result of making bosses no more 
		than mere game symbols obsolete.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--So when creating a unique world for a 
		game, it&#39;s fundamentally impossible to create something like Touhou with 
		more than one person?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		That&#39;s my opinion. In games where there are many people working on it, even 
		in a best-case scenario, only a few people are working on the game design. 
		As the game nears completion, several of these people are moved to other 
		roles to help. It&#39;s definitely the hardest phase of making a game. For my 
		latest game, &quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower View&quot;, while I had to ask a few people 
		for help, I was the only one working on it, and while making it, almost 
		no one else joined in. I think it was best for the game.</p>
		<p><br>
		For &quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower View&quot;, the theme I made was &quot;Enjoyable while 
		playing and after playing&quot;. Usually, you may think &quot;Playing is fun&quot;, and 
		it&#39;s exciting to do so, but if playing is all there is, then it&#39;s unexpectedly 
		not fun. Music that is enjoyable, an enjoyable world, setting, and characters, 
		and the entire atmosphere. If everything doesn&#39;t have that feel-good quality, 
		then it feels bad. That is, if you only investigate how it feels to play 
		the game, you won&#39;t see anything else.</p>

			<p><big style="font-weight: bold;">The Attitude of Indie Developers 
			Not Focusing on Sales and Continuing to Make Games They Like</big></p>
			<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
		<p><br>
		Now, I would like to say that even if a game doesn&#39;t sell very well, it 
		can still be a good game. I know it&#39;s a change in topic, but I would like 
		to speak more about it.</p>
		<p>So indie developers should not make it a goal to have their games sell?</p>
		<p>Absolutely not. If they can&#39;t sell any games, that&#39;s not good, but they 
		shouldn&#39;t let criticism affect what they do, and they should produce games 
		that they like. It&#39;s the same idea as I was talking about earlier, if they 
		give in to persuasion, they might start thinking about not doing certain 
		things like advertising, not even on their own website. Even any talk about 
		the games will disappear, as if it never existed.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--So the game becomes purposefully isolated?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		If it doesn&#39;t look like they are particularly busy, then that is the case. 
		However, if they are influenced by other games, then they will let other 
		people play their games who will then be influenced by that game, and a 
		vicious circle is avoided. Of course, I think that in the case of businesses, 
		not caring about how people view your games is a problem. They should be 
		proactive to get opinions through people who fill out surveys, fansites, 
		and other sources.</p>
		<p><br style="font-weight: bold;">
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--But in the case of indie developers, 
		it&#39;s better not to do that?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		Indie developers are basically mini-businesses, so they should act like 
		business, and always be looking ahead. I think that the consumers demand 
		too much from indie authors, things that are not indie-like. When you compare 
		the differences between businesses and indie developers, too many requests 
		and criticisms can wear down on the creator, so the market atrophies as 
		a result. In the case of Touhou, its scope is still widening, and there 
		are as many people playing it as there are playing commercial games, so 
		it can&#39;t really help appearing like one. That&#39;s why on the production side, 
		I can&#39;t ignore that fact even if I wanted to, although I wouldn&#39;t mind too 
		much if the whole thing cooled down. (lol)</p>
		<p><br style="font-weight: bold;">
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--By the way, what programs do you use 
		in the development of the Touhou games?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		I don&#39;t use the software or programs that most indie developers generally 
		use when I make my games. On my computer, I use my own<img style="width: 300px; height: 300px; float: right;" alt="" src="167BAiJRReimu.png" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20"> 
		version of DOS-V, my development environment is a compiler, Visual Studio. 
		For pictures, it&#39;s generally Photoshop, and for music I use Cubase SX, but 
		not Prouse. It was a lot harder for indie developers to make games 10 years 
		ago... No matter what you made, it took a lot of blood, sweat, and effort. 
		I don&#39;t like my expression when I exert a lot of effort so I don&#39;t do it 
		very often. (lol)</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--Do you have any advice for people who 
		want to make games?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		I think that people who want to work for a game company and those who want 
		to make games should receive separate advice. First, to those who want to 
		work for a game company, the ratio of people who want to work for a company 
		versus the number who are actually hired is incredibly large, so to stand 
		out, it&#39;s important to hone and improve your unique qualities. I presented 
		Touhou to demonstrate mine, but I still needed to put a considerable amount 
		of effort into it.</p>
		<p>Also, there are a lot of people who want to work for a game company who 
		go to college or technical school, but because they feel the gap between 
		what they want to do and the regular office work they actually do, almost 
		all of them quit. So maybe, if you don&#39;t want to make games, you might still 
		want to work for a game company. Some advice for people who want to make 
		games, you might want to exclusively study it, but I want to say people 
		study in a regular manner and go to college. If you can adapt to your surroundings, 
		you can improve yourself as a person.</p>
		<p><br>
		</p>
		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<p><big style="font-weight: bold;">Pursuing the Feel-good Quality for 
			&quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower View&quot;</big></p>
			<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--The theme for &quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower 
		View&quot; seems to be about flowers and other cheerful things. (lol) What is 
		the game about?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		It&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to make. &quot;Phantasmagoria of Flower View&quot; 
		is a game I made with the notion of something that you can play while at 
		ease and still have fun. I think that people who don&#39;t like serious scenarios 
		should still stick with them, but on the other hand, I realized that everyone 
		who plays Touhou might not have enjoyed them. Even though the response to 
		the trial version has been positive, I&#39;m actually a little confused. (lol)</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--So the music is enjoyable as well?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		Until now, while the music hasn&#39;t not been fitting to the stage it&#39;s for, 
		there were considerable limits. But this time, there is nothing resembling 
		progression within a stage and the only thing that flows is the background. 
		It felt good and because of that reason, I thought I could compose some 
		really beautiful songs. As the song repeats during the game, then it gets 
		stuck in your head. By doing away with any message in the story and just 
		having simple lines, it was the first time where I didn&#39;t have to think 
		about arranging the music around them.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--How will the story feel in the game?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		While I think giving it a rather tense feel makes it interesting, it&#39;s still 
		a little long so I&#39;m presently fine-tuning it. (lol) This time, each character 
		will have their own ending, so with repeated playthroughs, you can learn 
		all kinds of things about the characters as well as their relationships. 
		If you play through it once, you won&#39;t understand everything well, just 
		as the characters themselves don&#39;t fully understand the events that unfold 
		by the end, but that&#39;s just another Touhou-like thing about the game.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--A versus shmup was unexpected. What was 
		your intention?</span></p>
		<p><br>
		While I wasn&#39;t planning on making a game this year, it&#39;s Touhou&#39;s 10th anniversary 
		so I thought really, really hard about it. Over this time period, a lot 
		of people are playing the Touhou games, so I wanted to do something that 
		would get everyone excited... so I intended for this to be a fan-service 
		game. So, I decided to make a game like &quot;Twinkle Star Sprites&quot;. Maybe the 
		people who play Touhou haven&#39;t played &quot;Twinkle Star&quot;, maybe they have. I 
		don&#39;t think the game itself is about fighting though. In a restaurant, after 
		a person has decided how much they want to eat, the customer&#39;s shouldn&#39;t 
		steal the shop&#39;s originality. However, in the case of games, it&#39;s no big 
		deal. Instead, the thought process is that if they copy something good, 
		then everyone who is interested in those kinds of games will also be drawn 
		in. Among shmups, this kind of sharing isn&#39;t called stealing, it&#39;s called 
		respect. This kind of synergy increases the whole shmup scene by another 
		level. That&#39;s what I&#39;m aiming for.</p>
		<p><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">--Finally, I&#39;d like to ask about where 
		you place this book, &quot;Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red&quot;.</span></p>
		<p><br>
		This book and the game, &quot;Shoot The Bullet&quot; have a mutual influence on each 
		other, and I wanted to make something that would give people who already 
		know about Touhou an even greater reason to enjoy it. That&#39;s why the story 
		of this book is a bunch of interesting news articles about all kinds of 
		things. While I don&#39;t know how many people play the games, I wanted to give 
		anyone familiar with the series and in-depth and up-close look at it. So 
		I guess I didn&#39;t make this book for newbies, but for people who have had 
		at least some experience with it, to encourage them. But if by accident 
		someone new does read this book... they might be surprised. (lol)</p>
