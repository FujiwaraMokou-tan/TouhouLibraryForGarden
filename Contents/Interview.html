            To accompany this second serialized spin-off, and with the upcoming
            release of Phantasmagoria of Flower View, the kannushi of fantasy,
            ZUN, will show the inner workings of his mind and activities. The
            goal of this book was to confront how ZUN has not talked about the
            game from a story or creative stance, and to express the concept
            behind his new game PoFV.

              of his games. First, may I ask how you felt the first time you
              played a game?</span

          <p>
            In the cafe at my parent's house, when I was in kindergarden they
            placed a table arcade machine there to lighten up the atmosphere.
            Because of that, I was greatly interested in games, and during
            elementary school, the NES came out and we bought one right away.
            When I got a new game, I'd play them with my friends for as long as
            we could. But normally I would go outside and catch bugs too. I was
            a normal countryside kid after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--What game from back then left an impression on you?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Super Mario Bros. left the biggest impression on me. Before then,
            games didn't scroll, and there were still many games with black
            backgrounds. But in Super Mario Bros., if you went underground,
            there was an underground world. If you went above the clouds, there
            was a world above the clouds. All the different places you could go
            in itself surprised me, and every time I went somewhere new, I was
            impressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next impact was from... Street Fighter 2. That game's impression
            was almost like a second revolution. Everyone would play the game,
            so it was a way to fight without physically hurting each other. The
            play control was important too. I would put in up to 10,000 yen in a
            day sometimes. That made my allowance disappear in a flash though.
            (lol)
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--In both of these games, what points about the game's genre or
              nature were important?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Those games were revolutionary because they had things like
            different systems from games before them, creating new atmospheres
            within themselves. Later, people would say stuff like That game
            engine was revolutionary or The characters had a lot of appeal, but
            at the time, no one really thought about the individual aspects
            because they were too busy playing. But that wasn't really the case,
            it was just popular to say. The systems in those games weren't just
            the pinnacle of all the games made up to that point, there was also
            a decisive difference. I wouldn't go as far as to call it creating a
            new world -- it's a little different from the usual meaning -- but
            they were called the new standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to speak about my thoughts on game design, about establishing
            the foundation for creating a world, and designing a new world for
            my works. At the base of everything is the game world, and I
            structure the game's genre and system upon that, from which the
            pictures and the music flows. One can feel this establishment as
            they play the game, so I believe. That's why the game's genre as it
            is called is not just one part of the game, but if you get too
            obsessed about that, it will lose all meaning as a video game and
            will only create anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of people say The true nature of a game is it's genre, and the
            genre and the world it takes place in are different things. often,
            however, I don't think that they are contradictory concepts, and
            that they should be thought of as one. If you look at Xevious or
            Space Invaders, it is obvious that even at that time, games weren't
            mere collections of symbols. For example, the very first video game
            was only about bouncing a ball back and forth, but that wasn't how
            it was originally played. It was called Tennis. Just how the first
            game was based on Tennis that took place in The World, that's what I
            consider when I make games.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even with that theory, if it's not interesting, it probably
            can't be considered a success. On the other hand, only focusing on
            the basics isn't interesting either, so it is important to be able
            to connect both aspects to make a fun game. As one gains experience,
            being able to adjust to a game's genre or parts of its system is
            unmistakably engaging, and I think that games without that spark are
            missing the point. Before it can be played as a game, I think it is
            very important for my works to have its own setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--Now, when you say creating a world, that comes with very broad
              implications, so I imagine there will be many different approaches
              to establishing a world.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Please think of the quality of a created world and how well it is
            established as different things. For example, take sci-fi worlds or
            retro worlds. How well they are liked relates to the quality of how
            a world is established. On the other side, how well the music and
            the backgrounds match the world, how the game controls relating to
            the world, even up to entering a name for a high score, those are
            aspects relating to the quality of a created world.
          </p>
          <p>

              hspace="20"
              vspace="20"
            />The way I see it, however you decide to establish a world, you
            need to decide on the the design of the created world. During the
            establishment of a game, particularly when making characters for the
            so-called world creation, people make the mistake of saying This
            won't have any effect on the game, but even among these people there
            are those who say Because this character is in the game, I hate it.
            This claim is proof enough that even characters can influence a
            game. But in cases where there is truly no connection, then it never
            mattered how the game was established in the first place. This means
            that the hate that is felt is proportional to how much influence the
            aspect has on the game. However, I recognize that there were bad
            games with well-designed worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Battle Garegga (*1), there was a very charismatic last boss
            called Black Heart. That is a good example of how a game's design
            can really make a character appealing. Before his appearance, you
            would see a lot of evidence of him commanding his army during the
            stages in the game. That was very important.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--Is creating a world the same as giving meaning to every
              individual element in the game?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            For that, I'd like to talk about Cave, who have always done a great
            job in creating their worlds. In Progear (*2), the look of the game
            changes as time passes from morning to evening, then to night, and
            when you start the second loop, it's morning again. A simple thing
            like the flow of time gives a real feeling of progression. There is
            a similar effect in Guwange (*3), where it goes from the white color
            scheme in the town, to the darkness of Hell at the end. The stages
            flow smoothly, and in addition, it starts out in summer, and goes to
            fall, winter, and spring. The look of the game's stages have
            meaning. In games made like this, the player gets absorbed into the
            game world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Darius Gaiden too, even though it seems like the most attention
            was given to what genre it was because it was popular, I think that
            the world inside it was very good too. The fact is, I was influenced
            by Darius Gaiden when I made the Touhou games.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--Can you give any specific examples of this influence?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In Darius Gaiden, there would be boss battles as long as 2/3rds of
            the stage, and the bosses would have personalities. Another
            characteristic is that the game would be organized solely to keep
            things exciting during the middle. Until then, when talking about
            games, people would only say things like Stage 3 was fun, Stage 4
            was..., but in Darius Gaiden, there was Octopus, and Greatthing, and
            people could call bosses by name when they talked about the game. It
            meant that these game symbols were becoming something else. This
            change of turning symbols into characters made its way into Touhou
            too. So, the first point of influence is making the games to heavily
            favor boss battles, the second is the shooting aspect, with the
            Spellcard danmaku attack system, and the third is the result of
            making bosses no more than mere game symbols obsolete.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--So when creating a unique world for a game, it's fundamentally
              impossible to create something like Touhou with more than one
              person?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            That's my opinion. In games where there are many people working on
            it, even in a best-case scenario, only a few people are working on
            the game design. As the game nears completion, several of these
            people are moved to other roles to help. It's definitely the hardest
            phase of making a game. For my latest game, Phantasmagoria of Flower
            View, while I had to ask a few people for help, I was the only one
            working on it, and while making it, almost no one else joined in. I
            think it was best for the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Phantasmagoria of Flower View, the theme I made was Enjoyable
            while playing and after playing. Usually, you may think Playing is
            fun, and it's exciting to do so, but if playing is all there is,
            then it's unexpectedly not fun. Music that is enjoyable, an
            enjoyable world, setting, and characters, and the entire atmosphere.
            If everything doesn't have that feel-good quality, then it feels
            bad. That is, if you only investigate how it feels to play the game,
            you won't see anything else.

                The Attitude of Indie Developers Not Focusing on Sales and
                Continuing to Make Games They Like</p>

          <p>
            Now, I would like to say that even if a game doesn't sell very well,
            it can still be a good game. I know it's a change in topic, but I
            would like to speak more about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So indie developers should not make it a goal to have their games
            sell?
          </p>
          <p>
            Absolutely not. If they can't sell any games, that's not good, but
            they shouldn't let criticism affect what they do, and they should
            produce games that they like. It's the same idea as I was talking
            about earlier, if they give in to persuasion, they might start
            thinking about not doing certain things like advertising, not even
            on their own website. Even any talk about the games will disappear,
            as if it never existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--So the game becomes purposefully isolated?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If it doesn't look like they are particularly busy, then that is the
            case. However, if they are influenced by other games, then they will
            let other people play their games who will then be influenced by
            that game, and a vicious circle is avoided. Of course, I think that
            in the case of businesses, not caring about how people view your
            games is a problem. They should be proactive to get opinions through
            people who fill out surveys, fansites, and other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--But in the case of indie developers, it's better not to do
              that?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Indie developers are basically mini-businesses, so they should act
            like business, and always be looking ahead. I think that the
            consumers demand too much from indie authors, things that are not
            indie-like. When you compare the differences between businesses and
            indie developers, too many requests and criticisms can wear down on
            the creator, so the market atrophies as a result. In the case of
            Touhou, its scope is still widening, and there are as many people
            playing it as there are playing commercial games, so it can't really
            help appearing like one. That's why on the production side, I can't
            ignore that fact even if I wanted to, although I wouldn't mind too
            much if the whole thing cooled down. (lol)

              Touhou games?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't use the software or programs that most indie developers
            generally use when I make my games. On my computer, I use my own<img

            version of DOS-V, my development environment is a compiler, Visual
            Studio. For pictures, it's generally Photoshop, and for music I use
            Cubase SX, but not Prouse. It was a lot harder for indie developers
            to make games 10 years ago... No matter what you made, it took a lot
            of blood, sweat, and effort. I don't like my expression when I exert
            a lot of effort so I don't do it very often. (lol)

            who want to make games should receive separate advice. First, to
            those who want to work for a game company, the ratio of people who
            want to work for a company versus the number who are actually hired
            is incredibly large, so to stand out, it's important to hone and
            improve your unique qualities. I presented Touhou to demonstrate
            mine, but I still needed to put a considerable amount of effort into
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, there are a lot of people who want to work for a game company
            who go to college or technical school, but because they feel the gap
            between what they want to do and the regular office work they
            actually do, almost all of them quit. So maybe, if you don't want to
            make games, you might still want to work for a game company. Some
            advice for people who want to make games, you might want to
            exclusively study it, but I want to say people study in a regular
            manner and go to college. If you can adapt to your surroundings, you
            can improve yourself as a person.

          <p>
            It's something I've always wanted to make. Phantasmagoria of Flower
            View is a game I made with the notion of something that you can play
            while at ease and still have fun. I think that people who don't like
            serious scenarios should still stick with them, but on the other
            hand, I realized that everyone who plays Touhou might not have
            enjoyed them. Even though the response to the trial version has been
            positive, I'm actually a little confused. (lol)
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >--So the music is enjoyable as well?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Until now, while the music hasn't not been fitting to the stage it's
            for, there were considerable limits. But this time, there is nothing
            resembling progression within a stage and the only thing that flows
            is the background. It felt good and because of that reason, I
            thought I could compose some really beautiful songs. As the song
            repeats during the game, then it gets stuck in your head. By doing
            away with any message in the story and just having simple lines, it
            was the first time where I didn't have to think about arranging the
            music around them.

            <span style="font-weight: bold"

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            While I think giving it a rather tense feel makes it interesting,
            it's still a little long so I'm presently fine-tuning it. (lol) This
            time, each character will have their own ending, so with repeated
            playthroughs, you can learn all kinds of things about the characters
            as well as their relationships. If you play through it once, you
            won't understand everything well, just as the characters themselves
            don't fully understand the events that unfold by the end, but that's
            just another Touhou-like thing about the game.

            While I wasn't planning on making a game this year, it's Touhou's
            10th anniversary so I thought really, really hard about it. Over
            this time period, a lot of people are playing the Touhou games, so I
            wanted to do something that would get everyone excited... so I
            intended for this to be a fan-service game. So, I decided to make a
            game like Twinkle Star Sprites. Maybe the people who play Touhou
            haven't played Twinkle Star, maybe they have. I don't think the game
            itself is about fighting though. In a restaurant, after a person has
            decided how much they want to eat, the customer's shouldn't steal
            the shop's originality. However, in the case of games, it's no big
            deal. Instead, the thought process is that if they copy something
            good, then everyone who is interested in those kinds of games will
            also be drawn in. Among shmups, this kind of sharing isn't called
            stealing, it's called respect. This kind of synergy increases the
            whole shmup scene by another level. That's what I'm aiming for.

            This book and the game, Shoot The Bullet have a mutual influence on
            each other, and I wanted to make something that would give people
            who already know about Touhou an even greater reason to enjoy it.
            That's why the story of this book is a bunch of interesting news
            articles about all kinds of things. While I don't know how many
            people play the games, I wanted to give anyone familiar with the
            series and in-depth and up-close look at it. So I guess I didn't
            make this book for newbies, but for people who have had at least
            some experience with it, to encourage them. But if by accident
            someone new does read this book... they might be surprised. (lol)
