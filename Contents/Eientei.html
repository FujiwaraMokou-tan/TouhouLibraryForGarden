		<p>Enveloped in perpetual mist&#65380; there is an expansive bamboo forest with 
		poor visibility.</p>
		<p>The bamboo grows so quickly, it is useless to use them as landmarks.</p>
		<p>Because of that, if one loses their way, they may never arrive at their 
		destination.</p>
		<p>It appears that there is a large, old mansion within the bamboo forest, 
		hiding as if to avoid the public eye.</p>
		<p>This old mansion is called Eientei. Built on the traditions of the old-fashioned 
		Japanese mansions, there isn&#39;t a single sign of wear, as it is literally 
		eternally unchanging.</p>
		<p>When visiting Eientei, not the faintest amount of light reaches the bottom, 
		so everything is dark, and the only sounds that can be heard are the bamboo 
		leaves rustling in the wind.</p>
		<p>One cannot tell if it&#39;s day or night, or if a friend is present or absent.</p>
		<p>It is as though this forest has taken on the illusion of existing outside 
		the flow of time and history.</p>
		<p>In the perpetually noisy Gensokyo, Eientei is a quiet place, protected 
		by the bamboo forest.</p>
		<p>It appears that here is a place where nothing happens and nothing changes.</p>
		<p>Because of this, those who were here from the beginning knew there was 
		something going when they felt something unusual.</p>
		<p>Incidents and unusual occurances are like knots in their everyday life.</p>
		<p>Also, they are also aware of pauses in the flow of time during these 
		unusual moments.</p>
		<p>Like history is the record of time during every life, there are ways 
		to record time during these periods when time flows unusually.</p>
		<p>Historic accomplishments can happen with a single word, and when time 
		is stopped there is no other way to do so.</p>
		<p>As proof of this, no one says a word about anything that happens during 
		everyday lfe.</p>
		<p>Eientei is a place where those who do these unusual things live.</p>
		<p>A resident of this mansion is a moon rabbit, a souvenir from the moon. 
		Everything here is unusual, so the flow of time must be rejected.</p>
		<p>For that reason, the head of the household named this mansion Eientei.</p>
		<p>It appears that those who like unusual feelings live here, and they seem 
		to enjoy the company of visitors on occasion.</p>
		<p>However, they&#39;re only able to talk with those who manage to find their 
		way through the bamboo forest.</p>
