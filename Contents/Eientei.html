          <p>
            Enveloped in perpetual mist&#65380; there is an expansive bamboo
            forest with poor visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bamboo grows so quickly, it is useless to use them as landmarks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of that, if one loses their way, they may never arrive at
            their destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that there is a large, old mansion within the bamboo
            forest, hiding as if to avoid the public eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            This old mansion is called Eientei. Built on the traditions of the
            old-fashioned Japanese mansions, there isn't a single sign of wear,
            as it is literally eternally unchanging.
          </p>
          <p>
            When visiting Eientei, not the faintest amount of light reaches the
            bottom, so everything is dark, and the only sounds that can be heard
            are the bamboo leaves rustling in the wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            One cannot tell if it's day or night, or if a friend is present or
            absent.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is as though this forest has taken on the illusion of existing
            outside the flow of time and history.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the perpetually noisy Gensokyo, Eientei is a quiet place,
            protected by the bamboo forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that here is a place where nothing happens and nothing
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, those who were here from the beginning knew there
            was something going when they felt something unusual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incidents and unusual occurances are like knots in their everyday
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, they are also aware of pauses in the flow of time during these
            unusual moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like history is the record of time during every life, there are ways
            to record time during these periods when time flows unusually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historic accomplishments can happen with a single word, and when
            time is stopped there is no other way to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            As proof of this, no one says a word about anything that happens
            during everyday lfe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eientei is a place where those who do these unusual things live.
          </p>
          <p>
            A resident of this mansion is a moon rabbit, a souvenir from the
            moon. Everything here is unusual, so the flow of time must be
            rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, the head of the household named this mansion
            Eientei.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that those who like unusual feelings live here, and they
            seem to enjoy the company of visitors on occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, they're only able to talk with those who manage to find
            their way through the bamboo forest.
