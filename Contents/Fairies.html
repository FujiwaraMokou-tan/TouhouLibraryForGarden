            />X month, X day, more than half a day has passed since it stopped
            raining but a rainbow is visible above the shrine, surprising
            eye-witnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover the rainbow is no usual rainbow, but the direction of the
            arc is reversed, so it is doubly surprising as it is a backwards
            rainbow.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the shrine maiden who thought it was most suspicious that a
            rainbow would appear while it wasn't raining went to ascertain the
            true character of this rainbow, she found out it was the work of
            three fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ones who caused all the fuss were Sunny Milk, Luna Child and
            Star Sapphire (all fairies.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I asked them for what reason they put forth the rainbow, and how.
          </p>
          <p>
            Huh? That was Sunny gathering light to heal an injury. To collect
            light she made it bend, so she made a rainbow around herself. (Star
            Sapphire)
          </p>
          <p>
            Really, I'm the one with the nastier injury.... The lightning struck
            me. Ouchie! Aah, I wonder if it will be night soon. (Luna Child)
          </p>
          <p>
            What started the incident was when they were flying in the sky
            during yesterday's thunderstorm, and they received a direct hit from
            lightning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunny Milk gathered up sunlight to heal the injury, and that was
            seen as a backwards rainbow.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in the middle of that healing, Sunny Milk expressed this
            sentiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, it feels good. The other two can't do this, but of course when
            it's a clear day all I do is sunbathe. I can heal myself in the
            sunlight. Yesterday I was hurt a little thanks to Star. So now I'm
            healing up. (Sunny Milk)
          </p>
          <p>
            Close to Sunny it is strangely radiant, a heat like summer
            compacted.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would seem like getting hit by lightning is usual fairy
            stupidity, but producing a rainbow to heal oneself gives a sense of
            dynamism not seen in the usual fairies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, no matter how you look at it Sunny Milk's injuries are
            minor, but instead the injuries of Luna Child who was with her seem
            severe.
          </p>
          <p>
            That might just be because Sunny Milk's treatment just looks like an
            afternoon nap.

            It is, isn't it? Did you recover fully from the injury in this case?

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm fine, thank you. I bathed in the sunlight as much as I could to
            make up for all the time I couldn't during the rainy season.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>That's right. I finally recovered too.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>How did Luna Child recover?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>I can recover as long as I have at least the moonlight.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>These two are both weakened when it rains.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>It's the end of the rainy season so it's no problem now!</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, being hit by a lightning bolt was a disaster for you. If I
            recall correctly, it was because it struck your umbrella, wasn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's what I remember! The one who thought to bring one was Star,
            it's her fault!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right! Star, you noticed that it looked like lightning was
            going to strike, didn't you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Huh? What are you saying? Because it was Sunny that insisted we
            continue with mischief. I was satisfied when we had tricked the one
            in black.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right! It was Sunny's fault! Whenever I have a bitter
            experience it's usually Sunny's fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>Since it's already summer, that's alright~</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine and all, but... Don't I always tell you that? The shrine
            maiden's intuition is the most dangerous thing for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>But you were done in by lightning.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pardon me. I'm not really fully understanding the conversation,
            could I perhaps have you explain it to me so I can understand?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's good that incident's already over. But it was still
            interesting, wasn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>It was.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine and all, but... I'm always the only one who has bitter
            experiences in the end, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>You're just obtuse.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You recovered from it, anyway. Well, why don't we think of our next
            trick to play soon?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>Good, good. Such spirit.</p>

          <p>All three of you are totally ignoring me, aren't you?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>

          <p>
            This is why fairies are troubled. They're always only thinking of
            themselves.
          </p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right. In our trick to completely fool the shrine maiden.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing these thoughtless pranks without knowing their own
            abilities. Really you're just like usual fairies, or maybe like
            that...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, it's OK, we can do something fun even without borrowing your
            strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>Sunny, you can do nothing much all alone.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sunny Milk </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You thought I'd be mad at that? I'm relying on both of your powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Star Sapphire </span>
          </p>
          <p>Ufufu. Next we're going to get the shrine maiden completely.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Luna Child </span>
          </p>
          <p>This time we won't fail.</p>

            Come on.... They don't listen to people at all, and I don't really
            know what they're saying. Is this a fairy garden...?
