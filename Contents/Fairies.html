		month, X day, more than half a day has passed since it stopped raining but 
		a rainbow is visible above the shrine, surprising eye-witnesses.</p>
		<p>Moreover the rainbow is no usual rainbow, but the direction of the arc 
		is reversed, so it is doubly surprising as it is a backwards rainbow.</p>
		<p>When the shrine maiden who thought it was most suspicious that a rainbow 
		would appear while it wasn&#39;t raining went to ascertain the true character 
		of this rainbow, she found out it was the work of three fairies.</p>
		<p>The ones who caused all the fuss were Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star 
		Sapphire (all fairies.)</p>
		<p>I asked them for what reason they put forth the rainbow, and how.</p>
		<p>&quot;Huh? That was Sunny gathering light to heal an injury. To collect light 
		she made it bend, so she made a rainbow around herself.&quot; (Star Sapphire)</p>
		<p>&quot;Really, I&#39;m the one with the nastier injury.... The lightning struck 
		me. Ouchie! Aah, I wonder if it will be night soon.&quot; (Luna Child)</p>
		<p>What started the incident was when they were flying in the sky during 
		yesterday&#39;s thunderstorm, and they received a direct hit from lightning.</p>
		<p>Sunny Milk gathered up sunlight to heal the injury, and that was seen 
		as a backwards rainbow.</p>
		<p>While in the middle of that healing, Sunny Milk expressed this sentiment.</p>
		<p>&quot;Ah, it feels good. The other two can&#39;t do this, but of course when it&#39;s 
		a clear day all I do is sunbathe. I can heal myself in the sunlight. Yesterday 
		I was hurt a little thanks to Star. So now I&#39;m healing up.&quot; (Sunny Milk)</p>
		<p>Close to Sunny it is strangely radiant, a heat like summer compacted.</p>
		<p>It would seem like getting hit by lightning is usual fairy stupidity, 
		but producing a rainbow to heal oneself gives a sense of dynamism not seen 
		in the usual fairies.</p>
		<p>Even so, no matter how you look at it Sunny Milk&#39;s injuries are minor, 
		but instead the injuries of Luna Child who was with her seem severe.</p>
		<p>That might just be because Sunny Milk&#39;s treatment just looks like an 
		afternoon nap.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s hot. Really, it feels like summer.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It is, isn&#39;t it? Did you recover fully from the injury in this case?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>I&#39;m fine, thank you. I bathed in the sunlight as much as I could to make 
		up for all the time I couldn&#39;t during the rainy season.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s right. I finally recovered too.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>How did Luna Child recover?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>I can recover as long as I have at least the moonlight.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>These two are both weakened when it rains.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>It&#39;s the end of the rainy season so it&#39;s no problem now!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Even so, being hit by a lightning bolt was a disaster for you. If I recall 
		correctly, it was because it struck your umbrella, wasn&#39;t it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s what I remember! The one who thought to bring one was Star, it&#39;s 
		her fault!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s right! Star, you noticed that it looked like lightning was going 
		to strike, didn&#39;t you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Huh? What are you saying? Because it was Sunny that insisted we continue 
		with mischief. I was satisfied when we had tricked the one in black.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s right! It was Sunny&#39;s fault! Whenever I have a bitter experience 
		it&#39;s usually Sunny&#39;s fault.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Since it&#39;s already summer, that&#39;s alright~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s fine and all, but... Don&#39;t I always tell you that? The shrine 
		maiden&#39;s intuition is the most dangerous thing for us.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>But you were done in by lightning.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Pardon me. I&#39;m not really fully understanding the conversation, could 
		I perhaps have you explain it to me so I can understand?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>It&#39;s good that incident&#39;s already over. But it was still interesting, 
		wasn&#39;t it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>It was.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s fine and all, but... I&#39;m always the only one who has bitter experiences 
		in the end, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>You&#39;re just obtuse.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You recovered from it, anyway. Well, why don&#39;t we think of our next trick 
		to play soon?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Good, good. Such spirit.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>All three of you are totally ignoring me, aren&#39;t you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>The next one will go much more smoothly!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This is why fairies are troubled. They&#39;re always only thinking of themselves.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>What? You&#39;d still like to join in our next prank?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>That&#39;s right. In our trick to completely fool the shrine maiden.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Continuing these thoughtless pranks without knowing their own abilities. 
		Really you&#39;re just like usual fairies, or maybe like that...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Well, it&#39;s OK, we can do something fun even without borrowing your strength.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Sunny, you can do nothing much all alone.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sunny Milk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>You thought I&#39;d be mad at that? I&#39;m relying on both of your powers.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Star Sapphire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>Ufufu. Next we&#39;re going to get the shrine maiden completely.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luna Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p>This time we won&#39;t fail.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
		</p>
		<p>Come on.... They don&#39;t listen to people at all, and I don&#39;t really know 
		what they&#39;re saying. Is this a fairy garden...? </p>
