            />Currently in the month of X, due to the temperature being
            significantly lower than the average at this time of year, the days
            of extremely cold weather continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this snow storm, traces of something believed to resemble a
            ritual have been spotted.
          </p>
          <p>A magic specialist says this is a ritual to summon spring.</p>
          <p>
            In a spring-summoning ritual, acting as if spring has come creates
            an incantation that invites spring to come in actuality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specifics aren't known, but signs of a person related to the
            cold wave being assaulted were found, which may or may not be
            related to this ritual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The victim of the assault was the youkai of winter, Letty Whiterock
            (youkai).
          </p>
          <p>
            Judging from the scene of the scuffle, she was completely beaten.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the ones who started this fight felt it was a more reliable
            method than the spring-summoning ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            After she recovered from being buried in the snow, she spoke
            critically of the event.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Summoning spring? I don't know what that is, but it was a
            human who attacked me, despite their fear of youkai. I was just
            flying around, enjoying the long winter. Blizzards are an uncommon
            occurance, so you'd think they would be more eager to enjoy
            it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The youkai who was attacked for her perceived connection to the cold
            wave did not agree with the idea of a spring-summoning ritual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most likely, the youkai celebrating the snow storm passed by the
            human-centered ritual or a place that was irritated by the cold, and
            then impulsively brought attention to herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the spring-summoning ritual is not complete once winter has
            been driven off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specialists say that after winter is driven away, there must be a
            ceremony to welcome spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the spring-welcoming ceremony, one makes things that look like
            cherry petals and then scatter them, making a cherry blossom
            blizzard, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible that the spring-summoning ritual will continue until
            spring comes.

          </p>
          <p>This year has been so wonderful.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Is it because of the long winter?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right. It'd be better if it would stay like this year-round.
            There's nothing good about spring. Just a whole lot of pollen
            floating around, that's all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, I wonder why this year's winter has been so long.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, do you suspect I'm behind this? It's beyond my abilities, I'll
            have you know.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That was just a guess on my part. But since they've finished the
            spring-summoning ritual, it ought to be here soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What kind of ritual is that? I'm just flying along, enjoying the
            weather, and suddenly I get attacked, for no reason whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I imagine even the humans are getting irritated. It's cold, and the
            blizzard shows no signs of stopping. If not for that, I doubt you
            would have been assaulted, since humans attacking youkai are
            practically unheard of.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>I guess you're right...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, among the humans I know, there's one that would come at you
            for no reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>This human... You can't mean...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who was welcoming spring... I mean, attacked you, wouldn't
            happen to be all red and white, by chance?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>Boo-hoo-hoo...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            There simply wasn't anything you could have done. Just think of it
            as a stroke of bad luck, and...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Does it even make sense? I was having so much fun playing around in
            the snow, and thought I'd tease the human that showed up just a bit,
            that's all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>By the way, what do you do during the other seasons?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I go into a deep sleep during spring, stay inactive through summer,
            and nap during autumn. I stay hidden and rest in places out of reach
            of the sunlight. I don't move or breathe much...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It sure is a tough life...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's why I must enjoy winter for all it's worth.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But it gets treated as a scapegoat during the spring-summoning
            ritual. Clearly, spring is more favored by everyone else. Can you
            really enjoy it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            *Sigh* Winter is supposed to be cold. It's wrong to treat it so
            cruelly!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Wouldn't everyone be happy if you tried to stay active in summer and
            reduced the heat a little?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, that's a good idea. Well, that's what I'd like to say, but I
            manipulate the cold. Don't confuse it with manipulating cold air
            like a certain fairy. [Cirno]
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>They sound similar to me...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Those fairies are just minor anomalies of nature. I, on the other
            hand, am a great youkai that lives in nature. When it's cold out,
            making it even colder is my greatest joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A youkai that has become complacent is a problem. A youkai's job is
            to attack humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>But I did attack that human from before...</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            But that doesn't work if you only come out as a sacrifice for a
            ritual. Anyway, I'm starting to feel chilly, so maybe I should leave
            now.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Letty</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's so cold of you. I thought you said it was almost spring...
