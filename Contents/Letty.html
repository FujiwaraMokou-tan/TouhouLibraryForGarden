		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: left;" alt="" src="BAiJRLetty1.JPG" hspace="20" vspace="20">Currently 
		in the month of X, due to the temperature being significantly lower than 
		the average at this time of year, the days of extremely cold weather continue.</p>
		<p>In this snow storm, traces of something believed to resemble a ritual 
		have been spotted.</p>
		<p>A magic specialist says this is a ritual to summon spring.</p>
		<p>In a spring-summoning ritual, acting as if spring has come creates an 
		incantation that invites spring to come in actuality.</p>
		<p>The specifics aren&#39;t known, but signs of a person related to the cold 
		wave being assaulted were found, which may or may not be related to this 
		ritual.</p>
		<p>The victim of the assault was the youkai of winter, Letty Whiterock (youkai).</p>
		<p>Judging from the scene of the scuffle, she was completely beaten.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the ones who started this fight felt it was a more reliable method 
		than the spring-summoning ceremony.</p>
		<p>After she recovered from being buried in the snow, she spoke critically 
		of the event.</p>
		<p>&quot;Summoning spring? I don&#39;t know what that is, but it was a human who 
		attacked me, despite their fear of youkai. I was just flying around, enjoying 
		the long winter. Blizzards are an uncommon occurance, so you&#39;d think they 
		would be more eager to enjoy it.&quot;</p>
		<p>The youkai who was attacked for her perceived connection to the cold 
		wave did not agree with the idea of a spring-summoning ritual.</p>
		<p>Most likely, the youkai celebrating the snow storm passed by the human-centered 
		ritual or a place that was irritated by the cold, and then impulsively brought 
		attention to herself.</p>
		<p>However, the spring-summoning ritual is not complete once winter has 
		been driven off.</p>
		<p>Specialists say that after winter is driven away, there must be a ceremony 
		to welcome spring.</p>
		<p>For the spring-welcoming ceremony, one makes things that look like cherry 
		petals and then scatter them, making a cherry blossom blizzard, for example.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s possible that the spring-summoning ritual will continue until spring 
		comes.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Spring still hasn&#39;t arrived, huh?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This year has been so wonderful.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is it because of the long winter?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s right. It&#39;d be better if it would stay like this year-round. There&#39;s 
		nothing good about spring. Just a whole lot of pollen floating around, that&#39;s 
		all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, I wonder why this year&#39;s winter has been so long.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ah, do you suspect I&#39;m behind this? It&#39;s beyond my abilities, I&#39;ll have 
		you know.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That was just a guess on my part. But since they&#39;ve finished the spring-summoning 
		ritual, it ought to be here soon.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What kind of ritual is that? I&#39;m just flying along, enjoying the weather, 
		and suddenly I get attacked, for no reason whatsoever.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I imagine even the humans are getting irritated. It&#39;s cold, and the blizzard 
		shows no signs of stopping. If not for that, I doubt you would have been 
		assaulted, since humans attacking youkai are practically unheard of.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I guess you&#39;re right...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, among the humans I know, there&#39;s one that would come at you for 
		no reason.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This human... You can&#39;t mean...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The one who was welcoming spring... I mean, attacked you, wouldn&#39;t happen 
		to be all red and white, by chance?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Boo-hoo-hoo...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There simply wasn&#39;t anything you could have done. Just think of it as 
		a stroke of bad luck, and...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Does it even make sense? I was having so much fun playing around in the 
		snow, and thought I&#39;d tease the human that showed up just a bit, that&#39;s 
		all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>By the way, what do you do during the other seasons?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I go into a deep sleep during spring, stay inactive through summer, and 
		nap during autumn. I stay hidden and rest in places out of reach of the 
		sunlight. I don&#39;t move or breathe much...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It sure is a tough life...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s why I must enjoy winter for all it&#39;s worth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But it gets treated as a scapegoat during the spring-summoning ritual. 
		Clearly, spring is more favored by everyone else. Can you really enjoy it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>*Sigh* Winter is supposed to be cold. It&#39;s wrong to treat it so cruelly!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Wouldn&#39;t everyone be happy if you tried to stay active in summer and 
		reduced the heat a little?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, that&#39;s a good idea. Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to say, but I manipulate 
		the cold. Don&#39;t confuse it with manipulating cold air like a certain fairy. 
		[Cirno]</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>They sound similar to me...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those fairies are just minor anomalies of nature. I, on the other hand, 
		am a great youkai that lives in nature. When it&#39;s cold out, making it even 
		colder is my greatest joy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A youkai that has become complacent is a problem. A youkai&#39;s job is to 
		attack humans.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But I did attack that human from before...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>But that doesn&#39;t work if you only come out as a sacrifice for a ritual. 
		Anyway, I&#39;m starting to feel chilly, so maybe I should leave now.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Letty</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s so cold of you. I thought you said it was almost spring... </p>
