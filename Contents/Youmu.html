		<img style="width: 300px; height: 226px; float: left;" alt="" src="038BAiJRYoumu.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">At 
		about 1:00 PM on X/X, a strange incident occurred in which a huge number 
		of ghosts flew over Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>The witnesses were all surprised, as they&#39;d never seen such a huge number 
		of ghosts before the sun had even set.</p>
		<p>Hearing the news, I chased them with my fastest feet in all of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>The ghosts numbering beyond my imagination formed a line, all heading 
		in the same direction.</p>
		<p>It was so cold inside the swarm of ghosts, and I couldn&#39;t help but feel 
		how strange the gap between this and the summer heat was.</p>
		<p>The one who led the group was Youmu Konpaku (Half-human Half-phantom), 
		who works as a gardener in the Netherworld.</p>
		<p>I directly asked her in flight why she led the huge number of ghosts, 
		and where they headed.</p>
		<p>&quot;I just came here to take everybody back to the Netherworld. Since the 
		boundary between this world and the Netherworld is thin at the moment, a 
		small trigger is enough to let them cross over to this world. Yesterday, 
		the people here made an ancestor-greeting fire all over Gensokyo; because 
		of that, some ghosts got confused by the greeting and came into this world. 
		A lot of ghosts took advantage of the situation to come to Gensokyo and 
		play around. That&#39;s why I&#39;m taking them back home.&quot;</p>
		<p>As she said, it was the first day of Bon Festival yesterday, so they 
		seem to have made an ancestor-greeting fire.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s ironic that the thoughtless fire called not only their ancestors 
		but also free ghosts.</p>
		<p>Also, the gardener gave the following warning about ghosts.</p>
		<p>&quot;Even if you see any ghosts, don&#39;t feed or make them pets. Once ghosts 
		get along with you, they won&#39;t part from you easily. And what&#39;s worse, you 
		may be possessed for the next three generations. Plus, ghosts are extremely 
		cold, so you risk getting frostbite if you touch them. If you find any ghosts, 
		please just ignore them or call Hakugyokurou or a shrine maiden.&quot;</p>
		<p>Though I felt no feeling of danger or foul play in this incident, it&#39;s 
		better not to provoke or eat any ghosts if they&#39;re found floating in the 
		air.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Though one year has passed since then, the number of ghosts doesn&#8217;t seem 
		to have decreased at all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#8217;m still doing my best. I&#8217;m supposed to be doing my best!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But this is the result.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p><span style="font-style: italic;">(Weeping)</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve already gotten used to ghosts. It&#39;s now an ordinary scene for ghosts 
		to be flying over Gensokyo.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Are you trying to be sarcastic?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Not at all. Maybe we&#39;re being more familiar with Netherworld, maybe you&#39;re 
		side by side with death; perhaps it&#39;s just like being at the risk of life?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to say, but it&#39;s definitely become easier 
		to take a trip between this world and the Netherworld. These days, living 
		humans and youkai come to the Netherworld without even thinking about it; 
		dead people come to this world, too.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is this situation okay?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s not okay, I guess.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You don&#39;t sound convinced.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The dead belong to the Netherworld; the living belong to this world. 
		Though the natural order of things is ideal, the world can still get by 
		if it changes just a little. The dead aren&#39;t about to come back to life, 
		and the living won&#39;t unexpectedly drop dead. So, I&#39;m not sure why I have 
		to keep the ghosts in the Netherworld and keep the living out.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you&#39;re confused, the situation will never return to normal, I guess.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Plus, the boundary between the Netherworld and the world doesn&#39;t look 
		like it&#8217;ll be repaired. I can&#39;t do anything by myself...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>By the way, you&#39;re also a living human, aren&#39;t you? Why do you work in 
		the Netherworld?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Me? I&#39;ve never thought of that. But I&#39;m a dead human, too, so... hmm.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Don&#39;t think on it too hard, or I&#39;ll get worried. I just asked so that 
		I might get an answer like &quot;I get a high salary&quot; or &quot;I have a lot of vacation 
		time&quot;.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve never gotten any salary... and what&#39;s vacation time?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;Ah, what a pity.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh , I don&#39;t need any sympathy... I get a snack at 3 o&#39;clock, and I&#39;ve 
		gotten sick leave before, I guess...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Truly a pity...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Anyways, I&#39;ve served the Saigyouji clan since I was born, so it&#39;s natural 
		for me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m starting to wonder if the natural thing to do is always right.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The natural order of things is ideal. They say it differs from person 
		to person, but I&#8217;m not talking about that kind of surface-level common sense. 
		The dead belong to the Netherworld and the living belong to this world; 
		the youkai eat humans and the humans defeat youkai. I&#39;ve been taught that 
		the natural order of the world is everyone&#39;s ultimate truth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And one of your &#39;natural&#39; things is to have no salary and no vacation 
		time?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Youmu</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
