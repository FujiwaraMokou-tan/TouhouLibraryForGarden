            />At about 1:00 PM on X/X, a strange incident occurred in which a
            huge number of ghosts flew over Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The witnesses were all surprised, as they'd never seen such a huge
            number of ghosts before the sun had even set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing the news, I chased them with my fastest feet in all of
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ghosts numbering beyond my imagination formed a line, all
            heading in the same direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was so cold inside the swarm of ghosts, and I couldn't help but
            feel how strange the gap between this and the summer heat was.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who led the group was Youmu Konpaku (Half-human
            Half-phantom), who works as a gardener in the Netherworld.
          </p>
          <p>
            I directly asked her in flight why she led the huge number of
            ghosts, and where they headed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just came here to take everybody back to the Netherworld. Since
            the boundary between this world and the Netherworld is thin at the
            moment, a small trigger is enough to let them cross over to this
            world. Yesterday, the people here made an ancestor-greeting fire all
            over Gensokyo; because of that, some ghosts got confused by the
            greeting and came into this world. A lot of ghosts took advantage of
            the situation to come to Gensokyo and play around. That's why I'm
            taking them back home.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she said, it was the first day of Bon Festival yesterday, so they
            seem to have made an ancestor-greeting fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's ironic that the thoughtless fire called not only their
            ancestors but also free ghosts.
          </p>
          <p>Also, the gardener gave the following warning about ghosts.</p>
          <p>
            Even if you see any ghosts, don't feed or make them pets. Once
            ghosts get along with you, they won't part from you easily. And
            what's worse, you may be possessed for the next three generations.
            Plus, ghosts are extremely cold, so you risk getting frostbite if
            you touch them. If you find any ghosts, please just ignore them or
            call Hakugyokurou or a shrine maiden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I felt no feeling of danger or foul play in this incident,
            it's better not to provoke or eat any ghosts if they're found
            floating in the air.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though one year has passed since then, the number of ghosts
            doesn&#8217;t seem to have decreased at all.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>

          </p>
          <p>
            I've already gotten used to ghosts. It's now an ordinary scene for
            ghosts to be flying over Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>Are you trying to be sarcastic?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not at all. Maybe we're being more familiar with Netherworld, maybe
            you're side by side with death; perhaps it's just like being at the
            risk of life?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know what you're trying to say, but it's definitely become
            easier to take a trip between this world and the Netherworld. These
            days, living humans and youkai come to the Netherworld without even
            thinking about it; dead people come to this world, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Is this situation okay?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's not okay, I guess.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You don't sound convinced.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The dead belong to the Netherworld; the living belong to this world.
            Though the natural order of things is ideal, the world can still get
            by if it changes just a little. The dead aren't about to come back
            to life, and the living won't unexpectedly drop dead. So, I'm not
            sure why I have to keep the ghosts in the Netherworld and keep the
            living out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're confused, the situation will never return to normal, I
            guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Plus, the boundary between the Netherworld and the world doesn't
            look like it&#8217;ll be repaired. I can't do anything by myself...
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            By the way, you're also a living human, aren't you? Why do you work
            in the Netherworld?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Me? I've never thought of that. But I'm a dead human, too, so...
            hmm.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't think on it too hard, or I'll get worried. I just asked so
            that I might get an answer like I get a high salary or I have a lot
            of vacation time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>I've never gotten any salary... and what's vacation time?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;Ah, what a pity.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh , I don't need any sympathy... I get a snack at 3 o'clock, and
            I've gotten sick leave before, I guess...
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Truly a pity...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, I've served the Saigyouji clan since I was born, so it's
            natural for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm starting to wonder if the natural thing to do is always right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Youmu</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The natural order of things is ideal. They say it differs from
            person to person, but I&#8217;m not talking about that kind of
            surface-level common sense. The dead belong to the Netherworld and
            the living belong to this world; the youkai eat humans and the
            humans defeat youkai. I've been taught that the natural order of the
            world is everyone's ultimate truth.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            And one of your 'natural' things is to have no salary and no
            vacation time?
