            />At dawn on X the Xth, a human snuck into several places and
            collected various strange objects, as revealed by a report from a
            victim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal snuck into the victim's house and tried to steal a tool
            called the Hakkero, which was the victim's treasured possession.
            Fortunately, the victim hadn't fallen asleep yet, so the theft was
            foiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal was Sakuya Izayoi (human), the head maid of the Scarlet
            Devil Mansion which stands on the edge of the lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the victim caught her, she had several odd things in her
            possession, so the victim followed her to the Scarlet Devil Mansion,
            suspecting was amiss.
          </p>
          <p>The criminal made the excuse below:</p>
          <p>
            These items are for a spell to go to the Moon. The mistress insisted
            that she wanted to go there before dawn, so I gathered the materials
            required for it. I would have returned everything when the sun rose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The day this happened, there was an incident that extended the
            length of the night to be longer than usual, which caused a rash of
            unusual occurances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal also seemed slightly confused and appeared to not fully
            understand her words.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pipe is a substitute for a rocket, a spinning top is for a
            gyroscope and the blood of a snapping turtle works as a liquid fuel.
            It certainly looks similiar, does it not? Of course, the Hakkero is
            a rocket engine... However, I really have no idea what 'Armstrong'
            meant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal is a sensible and reputable maid among the humans in
            Gensokyo, so her unusual behavior was beyond conspicuous that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, she has a habit of gathering unusual items like bamboo flowers,
            blue diamonds and the like. I think that led her to commit this
            strange crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The victim, Marisa Kirisame (human), made the following comment
            about the incident:
          </p>
          <p>
            Her takin' whatever she wants gets on my nerves. She said she'd give
            it back later, but she was obviously lyin'.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, the Hakkero was returned safely, so the victim didn't
            pursue further.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal maid and the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion
            also declined to comment. That's why their motivation and purpose
            are, in the end, uncertain.

            It has already been more than half a year. May I please ask you
            about the truth behind this incident?

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don't feign ignorance. I suppose you're involved not only in
            this, but the Eternal Night incident as well.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Yes, I can stop time, but not the night.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>But why did you collect all those strange things?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Those were Milady's orders. I cannot talk about the details. Please
            leave the premises.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Where is your mistress? I have some questions to ask her.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The lady doesn't remember such trivial matters. It would be a
            fruitless effort to ask her.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess that's that. Speaking of which, do you really not remember
            anything at all?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I do not remember. Have you not heard enough?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span>
          </p>
          <p>Those were items needed for the magic spell to reach the moon.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Ah, Lady Patchouli. I shall prepare the tea at once.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            It's already tea time and yet you haven't brought me tea, so I came
            to check.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Wait, a magic spell to reach the moon... You're going to use those
            items to go to the moon?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Who're you?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a newspaper reporter, and I seek only the truth. So how did it
            go? Did you go to the moon?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In the end, we failed. The magic of the outside world is too
            complex. It would be futile unless we concentrated all of the powers
            in Gensokyo. But what Sakuya ended up bringing me was not liquid
            fuel, but the message of the turtle, which I understood instantly.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>...I've put something unusual in today's tea.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The turtle's message? You mean like the proverb a difference like
            that between a snapping turtle and the moon?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Do you understand the meaning of that proverb at all? It doesn't
            really mean things that are similar looking but can't be compared.
            It means illusions and reality, the palpable and the abstract. So as
            soon as she showed me all that was needed, I knew we couldn't go to
            the moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sakuya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will be having tea time now. Will you be joining us as well, Miss
            Aya? I believe this conversation will take some time, so you are
            welcome to stay.
          </p>

            >(*Note from Shameimaru: The incident where dawn would not break,
            and the movement of the moon had completely stopped. The youkai
            easily influenced by the moon as well as the humans who sleep at
            night were quite confused. Of all the recent incidents, it was the
            most perilous. At the moment, the cause and offender are both
            unknown. In the end, the moon suddenly disappeared and morning came.
            Several denizens stick to unconfirmed information that the
            resolution started with the Hakurei shrine maiden and Sakuya Izayoi,
            but the entirety of the incident remains in the rumor mill.)
