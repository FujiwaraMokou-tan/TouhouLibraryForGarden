		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: left;" alt="" src="020Sakuya.JPG" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">At 
		dawn on X the Xth, a human snuck into several places and collected various 
		strange objects, as revealed by a report from a victim.</p>
		<p>The criminal snuck into the victim&#39;s house and tried to steal a tool 
		called the Hakkero, which was the victim&#39;s treasured possession. Fortunately, 
		the victim hadn&#39;t fallen asleep yet, so the theft was foiled.</p>
		<p>The criminal was Sakuya Izayoi (human), the head maid of the Scarlet 
		Devil Mansion which stands on the edge of the lake.</p>
		<p>When the victim caught her, she had several odd things in her possession, 
		so the victim followed her to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, suspecting was 
		amiss.</p>
		<p>The criminal made the excuse below:</p>
		<p>&quot;These items are for a spell to go to the Moon. The mistress insisted 
		that she wanted to go there before dawn, so I gathered the materials required 
		for it. I would have returned everything when the sun rose.&quot;</p>
		<p>The day this happened, there was an incident that extended the length 
		of the night to be longer than usual, which caused a rash of unusual occurances.</p>
		<p>The criminal also seemed slightly confused and appeared to not fully 
		understand her words.</p>
		<p>&quot;A pipe is a substitute for a rocket, a spinning top is for a gyroscope 
		and the blood of a snapping turtle works as a liquid fuel. It certainly 
		looks similiar, does it not? Of course, the Hakkero is a rocket engine... 
		However, I really have no idea what &#39;Armstrong&#39; meant.&quot;</p>
		<p>The criminal is a sensible and reputable maid among the humans in Gensokyo, 
		so her unusual behavior was beyond conspicuous that day.</p>
		<p>Yet, she has a habit of gathering unusual items like bamboo flowers, 
		blue diamonds and the like. I think that led her to commit this strange 
		crime.</p>
		<p>The victim, Marisa Kirisame (human), made the following comment about 
		the incident:</p>
		<p>&quot;Her takin&#39; whatever she wants gets on my nerves. She said she&#39;d give 
		it back later, but she was obviously lyin&#39;.&quot;</p>
		<p>This time, the Hakkero was returned safely, so the victim didn&#39;t pursue 
		further.</p>
		<p>The criminal maid and the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion also 
		declined to comment. That&#39;s why their motivation and purpose are, in the 
		end, uncertain.</p>

		Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>It has already been more than half a year. May I please ask you about 
		the truth behind this incident?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Ah, may I have your name please?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Please don&#39;t feign ignorance. I suppose you&#39;re involved not only in this, 
		but the Eternal Night incident as well.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Yes, I can stop time, but not the night.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But why did you collect all those strange things?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those were Milady&#39;s orders. I cannot talk about the details. Please leave 
		the premises.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Where is your mistress? I have some questions to ask her.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>The lady doesn&#39;t remember such trivial matters. It would be a fruitless 
		effort to ask her.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I guess that&#39;s that. Speaking of which, do you really not remember anything 
		at all?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I do not remember. Have you not heard enough?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those were items needed for the magic spell to reach the moon.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ah, Lady Patchouli. I shall prepare the tea at once.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s already tea time and yet you haven&#39;t brought me tea, so I came to 
		check.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Wait, a magic spell to reach the moon... You&#39;re going to use those items 
		to go to the moon?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Who&#39;re you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m a newspaper reporter, and I seek only the truth. So how did it go? 
		Did you go to the moon?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>In the end, we failed. The magic of the outside world is too complex. 
		It would be futile unless we concentrated all of the powers in Gensokyo. 
		But what Sakuya ended up bringing me was not liquid fuel, but the message 
		of the turtle, which I understood instantly.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>...I&#39;ve put something unusual in today&#39;s tea.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The turtle&#39;s message? You mean like the proverb &quot;a difference like that 
		between a snapping turtle and the moon&quot;?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Do you understand the meaning of that proverb at all? It doesn&#39;t really 
		mean &quot;things that are similar looking but can&#39;t be compared.&quot; It means illusions 
		and reality, the palpable and the abstract. So as soon as she showed me 
		all that was needed, I knew we couldn&#39;t go to the moon.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakuya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>We will be having tea time now. Will you be joining us as well, Miss 
		Aya? I believe this conversation will take some time, so you are welcome 
		to stay.</p>
		<br>
		<small>(*Note from Shameimaru: The incident where dawn would not break, 
		and the movement of the moon had completely stopped. The youkai easily influenced 
		by the moon as well as the humans who sleep at night were quite confused. 
		Of all the recent incidents, it was the most perilous. At the moment, the 
		cause and offender are both unknown. In the end, the moon suddenly disappeared 
		and morning came. Several denizens stick to unconfirmed information that 
		the resolution started with the Hakurei shrine maiden and Sakuya Izayoi, 
		but the entirety of the incident remains in the rumor mill.) </small>
