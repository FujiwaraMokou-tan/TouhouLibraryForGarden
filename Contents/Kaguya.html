		this month on, the &quot;Lunar Capital Expo&quot; is being held at Eientei to share 
		knowledge about the moon.</p>
		<p>Current exhibits include: moon rocks, the flag the humans planted on 
		the moon, and other relics that represent the peak of moon civilization. 
		A show demonstrating the traditional methods moon rabbits use to pound mochi 
		was also being planned.</p>
		<p>From the first day, a huge crowd of guests have come to visit, including 
		humans and youkai that have a high level of interest in the moon, with many 
		repeat visitors.</p>
		<p>The organizer for this event, Kaguya Houraisan ([self-proclaimed] human) 
		explains its intended purpose.</p>
		<p>&quot;Here at home, I have many items related to the moon. For some reason, 
		I felt I needed to keep them to myself at first, but...</p>
		<p>Now, I don&#39;t mind anymore and I wish for everyone to come pay to see 
		then, since it would be a waste to just hide them away.</p>
		<p>If I am able to instill even a little bit of interest in the moon through 
		this expo I will be just filled with elation.&quot;</p>
		<p>One of the showpieces is the the Moon History Building, where you can 
		learn about the previously unknown history of the Lunar Capital alongside 
		the fascinating tools and vehicles from back then.</p>
		<p>There is also an old cart that would fly in the sky despite being pulled 
		by oxen, kimono that continue to shine even now, and a lunar rover that 
		that can travel over any sort of lunar terrain.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s one of the charms of the Lunar Capital Expo that you can&#39;t tell 
		exactly how genuine the exhibits are.</p>
		<p>And starting from today, they are holding a moon rabbit mochi-pounding 
		show.</p>
		<p>Here, all the participants are given mochi pounded by the moon rabbit. 
		Two hours since the show started, the queue for the show already resembles 
		a long snake.</p>
		<p>A (self-proclaimed) rabbit from the moon, Reisen Udongein Inaba (rabbit), 
		said this when she saw the line:</p>
		<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter who pounds it, mochi still tastes the same.</p>
		<p>Just let me take a little break...</p>
		<p>I told them this plan wouldn&#39;t work, since I&#39;m the only moon rabbit here...&quot;</p>
		<p>If it becomes too disorderly due to the popularity, they may have a different 
		event for tomorrow.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, if they do plan an exciting new event, it may help 
		keep visitors from getting bored.</p>
		<p>The Lunar Capital Expo is like a fantastic virtual tour of the moon.</p>
		<p>Before winter comes, why not come over and see it?</p>

		<p>The Lunar Capital Expo ended with great success, but what did you think 
		of it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It went so well, I wouldn&#39;t mind having it every year.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Since the rabbit&#39;s mochi was so extremely delicious, I&#39;d like to write 
		a review of it next time, seeing as the article on the expo was well received.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, we haven&#39;t decided if we&#39;re going to hold another one, but if we 
		do it, I&#39;ll let you know.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, you had many strange things that have never been seen before 
		on display. How did you get a hold of all of them?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I just all of a sudden remember that I have them. My house is full of 
		ancient things that haven&#39;t even been touched since the time when I last 
		saw them.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So how long ago would that be?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Very, very long ago.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Let&#39;s see... you said these were all items from the moon, but they don&#39;t 
		look that out-of-the-ordinary to me...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, are you saying that I was cheating people?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, that&#39;s how exhibitions usually go. These kinds of events are good 
		times to use cheating and trickery.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There are a lot of people like that these days. They just have to see 
		through the cheating with your own cheating to enjoy the fabrication. A 
		story is a story. But if there are unbelievable truths mixed in with the 
		lies, would they still see through it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>In certain situations, you can.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Well, then, what is your honest opinion of the expo?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, I can&#39;t say for sure, but there seemed to be some fake items mixed 
		in.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see, it looks like you suspect everything unless you see it with your 
		own eyes. You seem like the kind of person who doesn&#39;t believe that humans 
		went to the moon, or thinks the Earth is flat.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s a cruel way of wording it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Regarding the Lunarians descending to the surface, does it matter if 
		it really happened?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>To begin, the part where I felt was kind of fake wasn&#39;t that.... or maybe 
		it was?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hmmm, it would be nice if it were.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Let&#39;s leave that topic aside, why do you have so many things that relate 
		to the moon?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Good question...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What was on exhibit at the Lunar Capital Expo is about average among 
		others with similar tastes for the fantastic.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, that is true. A taste for the fantastic has been part of my lineage 
		for a very long time.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>However I think of it, nobody would even think of collecting such strange 
		things. Normal people, that is.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Really? There were several times where we were almost robbed during the 
		exhibition, you know? Though our rabbit security force prevented that from 
		happening.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those with fantastic tastes are everywhere....</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaguya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s because Earth is like a place where the curious gather. </p>
