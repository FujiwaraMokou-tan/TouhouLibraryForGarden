            />From this month on, the Lunar Capital Expo is being
            held at Eientei to share knowledge about the moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current exhibits include: moon rocks, the flag the humans planted on
            the moon, and other relics that represent the peak of moon
            civilization. A show demonstrating the traditional methods moon
            rabbits use to pound mochi was also being planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the first day, a huge crowd of guests have come to visit,
            including humans and youkai that have a high level of interest in
            the moon, with many repeat visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organizer for this event, Kaguya Houraisan ([self-proclaimed]
            human) explains its intended purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at home, I have many items related to the moon. For some
            reason, I felt I needed to keep them to myself at first, but...
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I don't mind anymore and I wish for everyone to come pay to
            see then, since it would be a waste to just hide them away.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I am able to instill even a little bit of interest in the moon
            through this expo I will be just filled with elation.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the showpieces is the the Moon History Building, where you
            can learn about the previously unknown history of the Lunar Capital
            alongside the fascinating tools and vehicles from back then.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also an old cart that would fly in the sky despite being
            pulled by oxen, kimono that continue to shine even now, and a lunar
            rover that that can travel over any sort of lunar terrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's one of the charms of the Lunar Capital Expo that you
            can't tell exactly how genuine the exhibits are.
          </p>
          <p>
            And starting from today, they are holding a moon rabbit
            mochi-pounding show.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, all the participants are given mochi pounded by the moon
            rabbit. Two hours since the show started, the queue for the show
            already resembles a long snake.
          </p>
          <p>
            A (self-proclaimed) rabbit from the moon, Reisen Udongein Inaba
            (rabbit), said this when she saw the line:
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter who pounds it, mochi still tastes the
            same.
          </p>
          <p>Just let me take a little break...</p>
          <p>
            I told them this plan wouldn't work, since I'm the only moon
            rabbit here...
          </p>
          <p>
            If it becomes too disorderly due to the popularity, they may have a
            different event for tomorrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if they do plan an exciting new event, it may
            help keep visitors from getting bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lunar Capital Expo is like a fantastic virtual tour of the moon.
          </p>
          <p>Before winter comes, why not come over and see it?</p>

            The Lunar Capital Expo ended with great success, but what did you
            think of it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>It went so well, I wouldn't mind having it every year.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the rabbit's mochi was so extremely delicious, I'd
            like to write a review of it next time, seeing as the article on the
            expo was well received.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, we haven't decided if we're going to hold another one,
            but if we do it, I'll let you know.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, you had many strange things that have never been seen before
            on display. How did you get a hold of all of them?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I just all of a sudden remember that I have them. My house is full
            of ancient things that haven't even been touched since the time
            when I last saw them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>So how long ago would that be?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>Very, very long ago.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's see... you said these were all items from the moon, but
            they don't look that out-of-the-ordinary to me...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>Oh, are you saying that I was cheating people?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, that's how exhibitions usually go. These kinds of events
            are good times to use cheating and trickery.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of people like that these days. They just have to
            see through the cheating with your own cheating to enjoy the
            fabrication. A story is a story. But if there are unbelievable
            truths mixed in with the lies, would they still see through it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>In certain situations, you can.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span></p>
          <p>Well, then, what is your honest opinion of the expo?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, I can't say for sure, but there seemed to be some fake
            items mixed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I see, it looks like you suspect everything unless you see it with
            your own eyes. You seem like the kind of person who doesn't
            believe that humans went to the moon, or thinks the Earth is flat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's a cruel way of wording it.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span></p>
          <p>
            Regarding the Lunarians descending to the surface, does it matter if
            it really happened?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin, the part where I felt was kind of fake wasn't that....
            or maybe it was?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>Hmmm, it would be nice if it were.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's leave that topic aside, why do you have so many things
            that relate to the moon?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>Good question...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What was on exhibit at the Lunar Capital Expo is about average among
            others with similar tastes for the fantastic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, that is true. A taste for the fantastic has been part of my
            lineage for a very long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            However I think of it, nobody would even think of collecting such
            strange things. Normal people, that is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Kaguya</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Really? There were several times where we were almost robbed during
            the exhibition, you know? Though our rabbit security force prevented
            that from happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Those with fantastic tastes are everywhere....</p>

            It's because Earth is like a place where the curious gather.
