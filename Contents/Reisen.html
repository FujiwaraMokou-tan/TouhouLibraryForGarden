		Xember XX, the Rabbit Horn League protested the use of rabbit in the stew 
		ingredients for the shrine banquet.</p>
		<p>Talks remained distant as the shrine responded to the protest:</p>
		<p>&quot;Of course I&#39;m using rabbit...it&#39;s rabbit stew!&quot;</p>
		<p>The incident began when rabbit youkai crashed the shrine banquet.</p>
		<p>Upon spotting and tasting the delicious-looking stew, she realized the 
		meat in it was rabbit and reported this to the Rabbit Horn League leader, 
		Reisen Udongein Inaba (rabbit).</p>
		<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re using rabbit meat as a stew ingredient.</p>
		<p>How can something so savage be allowed?</p>
		<p>We of the Rabbit Horn League will continue to fight until rabbit meat 
		is off the dinner table for good!&quot; said Reisen.</p>
		<p>In response, the shrine&#39;s Reimu Hakurei said, &quot;What&#39;s so savage about 
		rabbit meat?</p>
		<p>It&#39;s been a normal food for ages.</p>
		<p>Or are they saying the rabbits themselves are savage?</p>
		<p>Well, I suppose running around fields for the heck of it might be considered 
		savage,&quot;</p>
		<p>indicating her stance that she would not stop the use of rabbit meat.</p>
		<p>The Rabbit Horn League, led by the Lunarian rabbit Reisen Udongein Inaba, 
		is a group believing in a rabbit utopia that bonds all Earth&#39;s rabbit youkai.</p>
		<p>Handling all the non-youkai Earth rabbits is Manager Tewi Inaba (rabbit).</p>
		<p>Manager Tewi had this to say:</p>
		<p>&quot;They&#39;re ordinary rabbits.</p>
		<p>humans are gluttonous pigs who&#39;ll eat anything, so maybe it can&#39;t be 
		helped if a few normal ones get eaten.</p>
		<p>If they want humans to stop eating them, they&#39;ll have to look a lot more 
		charming.</p>
		<p>You can&#39;t eat something cute, right?&quot;</p>
		<p>The manager is considering self-defense measures for the rabbits rather 
		than stopping the humans who eat them, so they have dissenting opinions 
		within the Rabbit Horn League.</p>
		<p>The opinions of the average rabbits are unclear.</p>
		<p>Currently, both parties have agreed to a compromise, in which chicken 
		stew will also be made available whenever rabbit stew is offered.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>At any rate, you&#39;ve compromised on offering chicken stew as well, though 
		I find that a bit touchy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Humans are so stubborn! We keep repeating ourselves, but they don&#39;t listen!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Despite her looks, that shrine maiden is so inflexible, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>She&#39;s adhering far too much to tradition and custom. Even if they don&#39;t 
		eat rabbit, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other options.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>There&#39;s potatoes, mushrooms, and wild vegetables.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Or poultry.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re saying that on purpose, aren&#39;t you. You think I&#39;m a bird.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re not?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, I am! I am!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>They can eat their fill of poultry, for all we care. We approve of grilled 
		chicken.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Changing the subject, why are you called the Rabbit Horn League? Rabbits 
		don&#39;t have horns.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And because we don&#39;t, they are a constant ideal. It means a group of 
		rabbits who are never satisfied with the status quo, but who always strive 
		for self-improvement.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see. And here I was sure it meant a group that horned in noisily on 
		just about everything.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I guess it&#39;s crow stew tomorrow.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>By the way, how were you able to reach a compromise with offering chicken 
		stew?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There was nothing to eat.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, so you&#39;re taking part in the banquet?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>We&#39;re protesting since we&#39;re taking part but have nothing to eat.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem to be losing the focus of your protest...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Who wants a banquet with nothing to eat? Or are you saying it&#39;s fine 
		as long as there&#39;s wine?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It depends on the mood and the wine, though I like some nibbles with 
		my drink.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Mind you, we&#39;re leaving management of the Earth rabbits to Tewi, so if 
		she says it can&#39;t be helped, that&#39;s it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Rabbit camaraderie&#39;s weaker than I thought.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>She&#39;s particularly cold.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What about you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m the only Lunarian rabbit, so I don&#39;t have that much camaraderie.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>And yet you formed the Rabbit Horn League? Even if without any camaraderie 
		or similar, carrying on so coldly just seems wrong.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, come on, the Earth rabbits won&#39;t listen to me at all!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re quite the leader.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, I&#39;m the only Lunarian rabbit, and too few Earth rabbits understand 
		human language...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s true enough, but I still can&#39;t believe you formed a league.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The League was just decided between me and Tewi. Since rabbits only follow 
		her orders, almost everything&#39;s left to her.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I see. So what&#39;s Tewi like?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reisen</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Apparently, she was controlling rabbits long before I got to Earth, but...well, 
		I don&#39;t really know any details.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d make such a reckless, suspicious rabbit your subordinate.
