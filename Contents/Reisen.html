            />On Xember XX, the Rabbit Horn League protested the use of rabbit
            in the stew ingredients for the shrine banquet.
          </p>
          <p>Talks remained distant as the shrine responded to the protest:</p>
          <p>Of course I'm using rabbit...it's rabbit stew!</p>
          <p>
            The incident began when rabbit youkai crashed the shrine banquet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon spotting and tasting the delicious-looking stew, she realized
            the meat in it was rabbit and reported this to the Rabbit Horn
            League leader, Reisen Udongein Inaba (rabbit).
          </p>
          <p>I can't believe they're using rabbit meat as a stew ingredient.</p>
          <p>How can something so savage be allowed?</p>
          <p>
            We of the Rabbit Horn League will continue to fight until rabbit
            meat is off the dinner table for good! said Reisen.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response, the shrine's Reimu Hakurei said, What's so savage about
            rabbit meat?
          </p>
          <p>It's been a normal food for ages.</p>
          <p>Or are they saying the rabbits themselves are savage?</p>
          <p>
            Well, I suppose running around fields for the heck of it might be
            considered savage,
          </p>
          <p>
            indicating her stance that she would not stop the use of rabbit
            meat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rabbit Horn League, led by the Lunarian rabbit Reisen Udongein
            Inaba, is a group believing in a rabbit utopia that bonds all
            Earth's rabbit youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Handling all the non-youkai Earth rabbits is Manager Tewi Inaba
            (rabbit).
          </p>
          <p>Manager Tewi had this to say:</p>
          <p>They're ordinary rabbits.</p>
          <p>
            humans are gluttonous pigs who'll eat anything, so maybe it can't be
            helped if a few normal ones get eaten.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they want humans to stop eating them, they'll have to look a lot
            more charming.
          </p>
          <p>You can't eat something cute, right?</p>
          <p>
            The manager is considering self-defense measures for the rabbits
            rather than stopping the humans who eat them, so they have
            dissenting opinions within the Rabbit Horn League.
          </p>
          <p>The opinions of the average rabbits are unclear.</p>
          <p>
            Currently, both parties have agreed to a compromise, in which
            chicken stew will also be made available whenever rabbit stew is
            offered.

            At any rate, you've compromised on offering chicken stew as well,
            though I find that a bit touchy.

          <p>
            Humans are so stubborn! We keep repeating ourselves, but they don't
            listen!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Despite her looks, that shrine maiden is so inflexible, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            She's adhering far too much to tradition and custom. Even if they
            don't eat rabbit, I'm sure there are plenty of other options.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>There's potatoes, mushrooms, and wild vegetables.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>Or poultry.</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You're saying that on purpose, aren't you. You think I'm a bird.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>You're not?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>No, I am! I am!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            They can eat their fill of poultry, for all we care. We approve of
            grilled chicken.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing the subject, why are you called the Rabbit Horn League?
            Rabbits don't have horns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            And because we don't, they are a constant ideal. It means a group of
            rabbits who are never satisfied with the status quo, but who always
            strive for self-improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I see. And here I was sure it meant a group that horned in noisily
            on just about everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>I guess it's crow stew tomorrow.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way, how were you able to reach a compromise with offering
            chicken stew?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>There was nothing to eat.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh, so you're taking part in the banquet?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We're protesting since we're taking part but have nothing to eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You seem to be losing the focus of your protest...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Who wants a banquet with nothing to eat? Or are you saying it's fine
            as long as there's wine?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It depends on the mood and the wine, though I like some nibbles with
            my drink.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Mind you, we're leaving management of the Earth rabbits to Tewi, so
            if she says it can't be helped, that's it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Rabbit camaraderie's weaker than I thought.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>She's particularly cold.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>What about you?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm the only Lunarian rabbit, so I don't have that much camaraderie.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            And yet you formed the Rabbit Horn League? Even if without any
            camaraderie or similar, carrying on so coldly just seems wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>Well, come on, the Earth rabbits won't listen to me at all!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You're quite the leader.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I'm the only Lunarian rabbit, and too few Earth rabbits
            understand human language...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's true enough, but I still can't believe you formed a league.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The League was just decided between me and Tewi. Since rabbits only
            follow her orders, almost everything's left to her.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>I see. So what's Tewi like?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Reisen</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Apparently, she was controlling rabbits long before I got to Earth,
            but...well, I don't really know any details.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't believe you'd make such a reckless, suspicious rabbit your
            subordinate.
