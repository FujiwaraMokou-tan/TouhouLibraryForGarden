            />&#12295; Month &#12295; Day, around 11:00 PM. In the atmosphere
            above Gensokyo there was a violent explosion of sound and light.
          </p>
          <p>The light was actually the large explosion of a shooting star.</p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, it was later confirmed that this explosion was created
            artificially.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, I'd like to touch on the mystery while reporting on the
            shocking contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who made this shooting star explode was Flandre Scarlet (a
            vampire).
          </p>
          <p>
            She's the sister of Remilia Scarlet, mistress of the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>The reason she blew up this meteorite is explained below.</p>
          <p>
            A shooting star? Look, to me something of that level is a pushover.
          </p>
          <p>Like 'kyu kyu kyu,' right?</p>
          <p>First of all, who cares about one little meteorite?</p>
          <p>
            Can't they understand that something like meteorites are meaningless
            to me?
          </p>
          <p>I'm more scared of spears falling.</p>
          <p>Actually, I'm more afraid of rain.</p>
          <p>Ah, manjuu aren't scary at all.</p>
          <p>
            Though it was mostly too incoherent to tell the meaning, at least I
            found that blowing up the shooting star was easy for her.
          </p>
          <p>I asked her how she blew up the meteorite.</p>
          <p>You know, everything has a thing, 'eye'.</p>
          <p>If I poke it like 'kyu', 'kaboom' will happen.</p>
          <p>
            Eh? How did I get close enough to the shooting star to poke it in
            the eye?
          </p>
          <p>The shooting star's eye is right here.</p>
          <p>
            Right in my hand. Or should I say the eye of everything is in my
            right hand.
          </p>
          <p>So I did 'kyuu' easily and...</p>
          <p>
            My investigation almost proved fruitless; however, I was able to
            have a very interesting talk with mistress of the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to what I heard, the meteorite was actually heading
            directly toward the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I heard how the meteorite was planned for that very
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was planned that the meteorite would fall on the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion on that day at that hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without intervention, not only the Scarlet Devil Mansion but the
            surrounding area would have suffered enormous damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only, the little sister blowing up the meteorite was also part of
            the plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's all I heard about the mistress, but it certainly was a
            strange talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The temperature rose and flowers are starting to open. It feels like
            spring has already come.
          </p>
          <p>Even if it is so warm, be careful not to catch a cold.</p>

            The incident was rather strange. I guess it maybe a work of spring
            weather.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's no good writing a newspaper when it can't be beyond facts,
            isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>The newspaper neither passes facts nor reports amusingly.</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>

          <p>Ahh, it's spring already. Will the first tea be soon?</p>

          <p>
            I have a feeling that asking you again will be a waste of time, but
            I'll ask one more time. No matter how, you really blew up the
            meteorite, didn't you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Is what Miss Remilia said the truth?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            About planning for the meteorite? There is no way that is true. That
            person just talks that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Her favorite saying?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, that's it. That person acts like she understands everything
            from the beginning. She talks about understanding fate or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Hey, you shouldn't call your elder sister that person.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh, how long have you been standing behind me? Big sister?</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, this is great timing. Just talking to the younger sister is...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>What? Are you saying you're not getting through to me?</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Exactly. You even realized that yourself, did you?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>So, what's this about good timing?</p>

          <p>About the meteorite explosion the other day...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh, that? Such a meteorite exploding goes with impunity.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...What did you mean when you said that it was planned?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you saying you don't understand Japanese, even though you write
            a newspaper story?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pardon me, but I have a hard time believing that you two are
            speaking Japanese.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>Just how long has it been since the arrival at Gensokyo?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll explain once again. The meteorite was not just planned ahead,
            it was made to fall through artificial means. It was aimed directly
            at our Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You call that Japanese?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Make no mistake, it's old Japanese. As proof that the meteorite was
            artificial, look at this meteorite fragment right here. It's clumped
            together using a magic spell, see?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>The spell isn't in Japanese, is it?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>See, do you still not understand what is happening?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, you're saying that someone used this meteorite to attack you,
            and that you fought back...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Flandre</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Dunno. I'll ask again. The spell written on the meteorite isn't
            Japanese, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It doesn't look Japanese to me, at least.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            No, it's old Japanese. Old, old Japanese. It's written as Leo meteor
            shower.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
