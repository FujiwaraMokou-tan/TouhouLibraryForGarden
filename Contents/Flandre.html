		Month &#12295; Day, around 11:00 PM. In the atmosphere above Gensokyo there was 
		a violent explosion of sound and light.</p>
		<p>The light was actually the large explosion of a shooting star.</p>
		<p>Surprisingly, it was later confirmed that this explosion was created 
		artificially.</p>
		<p>This time, I&#39;d like to touch on the mystery while reporting on the shocking 
		contents.</p>
		<p>The one who made this shooting star explode was Flandre Scarlet (a vampire).</p>
		<p>She&#39;s the sister of Remilia Scarlet, mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
		<p>The reason she blew up this meteorite is explained below.</p>
		<p>&quot;A shooting star? Look, to me something of that level is a pushover.</p>
		<p>Like &#39;kyu kyu kyu,&#39; right?</p>
		<p>First of all, who cares about one little meteorite?</p>
		<p>Can&#39;t they understand that something like meteorites are meaningless 
		to me?</p>
		<p>I&#39;m more scared of spears falling.</p>
		<p>Actually, I&#39;m more afraid of rain.</p>
		<p>Ah, manjuu aren&#39;t scary at all.&quot; </p>
		<p>Though it was mostly too incoherent to tell the meaning, at least I found 
		that blowing up the shooting star was easy for her.</p>
		<p>I asked her how she blew up the meteorite.</p>
		<p>&quot;You know, everything has a thing, &#39;eye&#39;.</p>
		<p>If I poke it like &#39;kyu&#39;, &#39;kaboom&#39; will happen.</p>
		<p>Eh? How did I get close enough to the shooting star to poke it in the 
		eye?</p>
		<p>The shooting star&#39;s eye is right here.</p>
		<p>Right in my hand. Or should I say the eye of everything is in my right 
		hand.</p>
		<p>So I did &#39;kyuu&#39; easily and...&quot;</p>
		<p>My investigation almost proved fruitless; however, I was able to have 
		a very interesting talk with mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion at the 
		end.</p>
		<p>According to what I heard, the meteorite was actually heading directly 
		toward the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
		<p>In addition, I heard how the meteorite was planned for that very day.</p>
		<p>It was planned that the meteorite would fall on the Scarlet Devil Mansion 
		on that day at that hour.</p>
		<p>Without intervention, not only the Scarlet Devil Mansion but the surrounding 
		area would have suffered enormous damage.</p>
		<p>Only, the little sister blowing up the meteorite was also part of the 
		plan.</p>
		<p>That&#39;s all I heard about the mistress, but it certainly was a strange 
		talk.</p>
		<p>The temperature rose and flowers are starting to open. It feels like 
		spring has already come.</p>
		<p>Even if it is so warm, be careful not to catch a cold.</p>

		<p>The ending is strange.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The incident was rather strange. I guess it maybe a work of spring weather.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s no good writing a newspaper when it can&#39;t be beyond facts, isn&#39;t 
		it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The newspaper neither passes facts nor reports amusingly.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ahh, it&#39;s spring already. Will the first tea be soon?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I have a feeling that asking you again will be a waste of time, but I&#39;ll 
		ask one more time. No matter how, you really blew up the meteorite, didn&#39;t 
		you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I went &quot;kyu&quot; and it went &quot;boom.&quot;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is what Miss Remilia said the truth?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>About planning for the meteorite? There is no way that is true. That 
		person just talks that way.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Her favorite saying?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yeah, that&#39;s it. That person acts like she understands everything from 
		the beginning. She talks about understanding fate or something.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hey, you shouldn&#39;t call your elder sister &quot;that person&quot;.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, how long have you been standing behind me? Big sister?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, this is great timing. Just talking to the younger sister is...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What? Are you saying you&#39;re not getting through to me?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Exactly. You even realized that yourself, did you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So, what&#39;s this about good timing?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>About the meteorite explosion the other day...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, that? Such a meteorite exploding goes with impunity.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...What did you mean when you said that it was planned?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Are you saying you don&#39;t understand Japanese, even though you write a 
		newspaper story?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Pardon me, but I have a hard time believing that you two are speaking 
		Japanese.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Just how long has it been since the arrival at Gensokyo?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ll explain once again. The meteorite was not just planned ahead, it 
		was made to fall through artificial means. It was aimed directly at our 
		Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You call that Japanese?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Make no mistake, it&#39;s old Japanese. As proof that the meteorite was artificial, 
		look at this meteorite fragment right here. It&#39;s clumped together using 
		a magic spell, see?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The spell isn&#39;t in Japanese, is it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>See, do you still not understand what is happening?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So, you&#39;re saying that someone used this meteorite to attack you, and 
		that you fought back...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flandre</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Dunno. I&#39;ll ask again. The spell written on the meteorite isn&#39;t Japanese, 
		right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It doesn&#39;t look Japanese to me, at least.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, it&#39;s old Japanese. Old, old Japanese. It&#39;s written as &quot;Leo meteor 
		shower.&quot;</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>...Oh, my. I wonder how much of that is true. </p>
