		master of medicine, Eirin Yagokoro (human [self-proclaimed]) has developed 
		a new dream medicine for modern troubled people that lets one &quot;enjoy sweet 
		dreams&quot;.</p>
		<p>The name of this new drug is Kochoumugan (Butterfly Dream Pill).</p>
		<p>It takes its name from the dream it induces, where one becomes a butterfly 
		and enjoys oneself.</p>
		<p>A few doses of the red pill before bed will prevent nightmares and create 
		an enjoyable dream for a good night&#39;s sleep.</p>
		<p>Eirin Yagokoro explains the specifics of what lead to the development 
		of this medicine.</p>
		<p>&quot;See, in Gensokyo, everyone are either youkai or demons or ghosts or 
		such, so they&#39;re all fit and robust. There isn&#39;t really much of a demand 
		for medicine for physical illnesses. These kind of beings are comprised 
		mostly of spirit. Therefore, if they need any sort of care it would be for 
		their mentality. The origin of the dream medicine was sparked by this realization.&quot;</p>
		<p>The dream world is another self, says Ms. Yagokoro.</p>
		<p>If the dream is too enjoyable, there&#39;s a chance that the real world and 
		the dream world may switch places, so one must be careful of overdosing.</p>
		<p>&quot;The medicine itself has existed since ancient times. In the past, there 
		were many humans who took the medicine and could not return from the dream 
		world. In this new formula, I&#39;ve weakened the potency and reduced the side 
		effects.&quot;</p>
		<p>However, there are people who say that good things happen in nightmares 
		as well.</p>
		<p>For those people who enjoy a little thrill in their dreams, the &quot;Kochoumugan 
		Nightmare Type&quot; is also available.</p>
		<p>This one is a black pill, and when taken, causes nightmares to occur.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s been a while. How are the Kochoumugan sales going?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Just a little here and there. This minor newspaper doesn&#39;t seem to have 
		much exposure.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m trying my best to improve that.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>In which areas is this newspaper distributed?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Most of those who want the latest news in Gensokyo the fastest are reading 
		it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Gensokyo is full of those who don&#39;t care what happens in the world as 
		long as their personal surroundings are fine. Exactly where would there 
		be anyone who needs information enough to get a newspaper?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...Mostly fellow tengu.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So it&#39;s like a school newspaper.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There are other readers. For example, Kourindo&#39;s owner is a loyal subscriber.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>He&#39;s not the target audience for Kochoumugan. I doubt he&#39;s worried about 
		nightmares.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>By the way, what kind of people buy Kochoumugan?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I can&#39;t release personal information for the sake of privacy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t think who bought what is really personal information.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That might be so. Since the purchase and selling of things is a system 
		humans established, prevention of the flow of information reduces the efficiency 
		of the system. Without information, a healthy market isn&#39;t possible, and 
		shady businesses can get away with cheating. In the first place, the reason 
		merchants say &quot;I won&#39;t leak your information&quot; is because it&#39;s just another 
		form of advertisement, to appeal to their customers. I&#39;m guessing what you&#39;re 
		trying to say that unless information is more open, the only ones making 
		a profit will benefit, yet they do not realize in doing so, the whole system 
		will collapse eventually, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, no, I didn&#39;t say that much. But I do agree that information shouldn&#39;t 
		be hidden.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Like how in the past, saying &quot;Dat ting? Da lady o&#39;er der bought &#39;em all 
		jest now, don&#39;cha know.&quot; and making the whereabouts of the products as clear 
		as day, they may have been hoping for a possible economical development.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Why the accent? But really, let&#39;s get back on track. You don&#39;t seem like 
		you want to tell me about your customers, after all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There&#39;s the puppeteer from the forest, for one.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve tried the Kochoumugan myself, but I don&#39;t really understand the 
		effect.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Huh? Is that true?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I did dream of becoming a butterfly flying gracefully through the air, 
		but whether that&#39;s an enjoyable dream or not is...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem to be carefree, after all. You weren&#39;t having any problems with 
		your dreams in the first place, right? You&#39;re not mentally exhausted enough 
		to need therapy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s also true, but... I guess what I mean to say is there wasn&#39;t any 
		sense of speed. Ever since I grew wings, I&#39;ve never flown so slowly before.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eirin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So that&#39;s what you meant. Well then, for you, please give the Nightmare 
		Type a try. It&#39;s so fast it might even be enjoyable. </p>
