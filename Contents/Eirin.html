            />Gensokyo's master of medicine, Eirin Yagokoro (human
            [self-proclaimed]) has developed a new dream medicine for modern
            troubled people that lets one enjoy sweet dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of this new drug is Kochoumugan (Butterfly Dream Pill).
          </p>
          <p>
            It takes its name from the dream it induces, where one becomes a
            butterfly and enjoys oneself.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few doses of the red pill before bed will prevent nightmares and
            create an enjoyable dream for a good night's sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eirin Yagokoro explains the specifics of what lead to the
            development of this medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            See, in Gensokyo, everyone are either youkai or demons or ghosts or
            such, so they're all fit and robust. There isn't really much of a
            demand for medicine for physical illnesses. These kind of beings are
            comprised mostly of spirit. Therefore, if they need any sort of care
            it would be for their mentality. The origin of the dream medicine
            was sparked by this realization.
          </p>
          <p>The dream world is another self, says Ms. Yagokoro.</p>
          <p>
            If the dream is too enjoyable, there's a chance that the real world
            and the dream world may switch places, so one must be careful of
            overdosing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medicine itself has existed since ancient times. In the past,
            there were many humans who took the medicine and could not return
            from the dream world. In this new formula, I've weakened the potency
            and reduced the side effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are people who say that good things happen in
            nightmares as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those people who enjoy a little thrill in their dreams, the
            Kochoumugan Nightmare Type is also available.
          </p>
          <p>
            This one is a black pill, and when taken, causes nightmares to
            occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just a little here and there. This minor newspaper doesn't seem to
            have much exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I'm trying my best to improve that.</p>

          <p>
            Most of those who want the latest news in Gensokyo the fastest are
            reading it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Gensokyo is full of those who don't care what happens in the world
            as long as their personal surroundings are fine. Exactly where would
            there be anyone who needs information enough to get a newspaper?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...Mostly fellow tengu.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>So it's like a school newspaper.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are other readers. For example, Kourindo's owner is a loyal
            subscriber.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            He's not the target audience for Kochoumugan. I doubt he's worried
            about nightmares.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>By the way, what kind of people buy Kochoumugan?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>I can't release personal information for the sake of privacy.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I don't think who bought what is really personal information.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That might be so. Since the purchase and selling of things is a
            system humans established, prevention of the flow of information
            reduces the efficiency of the system. Without information, a healthy
            market isn't possible, and shady businesses can get away with
            cheating. In the first place, the reason merchants say I won't leak
            your information is because it's just another form of advertisement,
            to appeal to their customers. I'm guessing what you're trying to say
            that unless information is more open, the only ones making a profit
            will benefit, yet they do not realize in doing so, the whole system
            will collapse eventually, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, no, I didn't say that much. But I do agree that information
            shouldn't be hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Like how in the past, saying Dat ting? Da lady o'er der bought 'em
            all jest now, don'cha know. and making the whereabouts of the
            products as clear as day, they may have been hoping for a possible
            economical development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Why the accent? But really, let's get back on track. You don't seem
            like you want to tell me about your customers, after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>There's the puppeteer from the forest, for one.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried the Kochoumugan myself, but I don't really understand the
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>Huh? Is that true?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I did dream of becoming a butterfly flying gracefully through the
            air, but whether that's an enjoyable dream or not is...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You seem to be carefree, after all. You weren't having any problems
            with your dreams in the first place, right? You're not mentally
            exhausted enough to need therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's also true, but... I guess what I mean to say is there wasn't
            any sense of speed. Ever since I grew wings, I've never flown so
            slowly before.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Eirin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's what you meant. Well then, for you, please give the
            Nightmare Type a try. It's so fast it might even be enjoyable.
