		said I needed to write an article about the noisy family of the Prismriver 
		Sisters, but I only recently met with the youngest sister, Lyrica Prismriver 
		(Poltergeist) who plays mysterious notes, after sending repeated requests.</p>
		<p>From the start I had an unwaning interest in how she makes these strange 
		notes so freely yet aren&#39;t supposed to exist.</p>
		<p>Today my doubts were answered as I went to verify them through a forceful 
		interview.</p>
		<p>For the uninitiated, the Prismriver Sisters are comprised of the oldest 
		sister, Lunasa Prismriver who plays violin, middle sister, Merlin Prismriver 
		who likes the trumpet, and the youngest sister Lyrica Prismriver who uses 
		the keyboard. They hold live concerts in many places in Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>But the youngest sister, Lyrica, whose keyboard-shaped instrument plays 
		unimaginable notes. Illusionary notes that cannot be found in nature.</p>
		<p>The sound quality is very high, and it can play many notes at the distinct 
		intervals. In fact these many faultless notes are its speciality.</p>
		<p>Nearly everyone who listens to it cannot hear anything else.</p>
		<p>&quot;This keyboard itself is like an illusion. Perhaps it could be said to 
		be the yuurei of an instrument that plays notes that have been lost in the 
		outside world. I don&#39;t really understand how it makes the notes, but as 
		long it can play them, there&#39;s no problem. For notes as well as instruments, 
		for them to be lost and become illusion, if they are lost in the this world, 
		they become yuurei. My notes are the notes of illusions, the notes of the 
		other world. It makes perfect sense for everyone to want to listen to them 
		in this world, yeah?</p>
		<p>She was talking about the notes that have greeted death.</p>
		<p>That is to say, yuurei can also play wondrous notes.</p>
		<p>These very mysterious notes like the blowing of horns and drum beats 
		give expressions like spoken words but cannot be heard.</p>
		<p>But if they should be called the yuurei of notes, these notes are like 
		the notes people would listen to in this world a long time ago. However, 
		they didn&#39;t know the reason why these notes cannot be heard today.</p>
		<p>In addition, the notes the girl plays are said to be notes that have 
		greeted death in the outside world.</p>
		<p>These illusionary notes must also exist in that world too.</p>
		<p>So to speak, these noisy ghost-like notes live at the highest point of 
		Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>And there is nothing else that symbolizes the yuurei of notes like the 
		keyboard.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s remarkable, isn&#39;t it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What is?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Because I can stir the emotions of people through notes that nobody has 
		ever heard.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>But you still have no idea how those notes are made, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s not necessary at all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>We will only approve of the remarkability of the notes after we approve 
		your services.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So you&#39;re saying you want to know how the notes are made? How about the 
		notes of thunder, the notes of the wind rustling through the trees, the 
		notes of cicadas chirping? I bet you can&#39;t explain a single one.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Explaining those is... difficult.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Right? That&#39;s the making of the notes is more remarkable than the person 
		who uses them.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Remarkable?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It was common for notes from some time ago to be made in nature, correct? 
		That&#39;s why nature is remarkable. If I were to use those kinds of notes it 
		wouldn&#39;t be remarkable at all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So the question is if your notes are remarkable?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Notes not from nature, illusionary notes. Sounds not of this world, sounds 
		that have greeted death. There&#39;s no one else who can use those kinds of 
		notes. That&#39;s why I&#39;m remarkable.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Remarkable indeed. By the way, about these illusionary notes, how did 
		you come to be able to use them?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You mean how I became a noisy ghost? A Poltergeist? It&#39;s only natural 
		I can use them. If I didn&#39;t use them it would be unnatural.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So that&#39;s just how it is, huh? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m satisfied with that 
		answer.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There&#39;s more to us than simply being noisy ghosts. It&#39;s more like we 
		are ghosts of noisiness.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So death is noisiness too?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The noisiness is the sound of living things. It&#39;s the notes of feelings, 
		emotions, and mood swings. The noisiness comes from an explosion of emotions 
		from the living. By this noisiness alone, we able to support ourselves as 
		poltergeists. Isn&#39;t that remarkable?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s not really remarkable.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>From my sisters&#39; changing moods I can combine that with my own remaining 
		emotions and express it as a song. The emotions are linked through dreams, 
		and me and my sisters can create the noisiness of living things. The living 
		call the music we create the music of ghosts, ghost songs. Remarkable, isn&#39;t 
		it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When people who play music talk about difficult concepts every word starts 
		to blur. Your sisters have nothing on you when it comes to talking about 
		difficult subjects.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s because our notes are our life. It really isn&#39;t that hard to understand.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It may be easy for you, but I have a much harder time with it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;So you can&#39;t enjoy music unless you can understand it? If you don&#39;t 
		understand the notes you&#39;re hearing it doesn&#39;t lift your spirits? You can&#39;t 
		decide if the skill of a musical group is great or not and you never talk 
		about songs? I can&#39;t imagine how small the entrance into a heart like that 
		must be... That&#39;s almost like a human&#39;s.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, you&#39;re absolutely correct. Hearts can be moved by music, and noise 
		is the best kind of music.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrica</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You got that right. </p>
