            />I said I needed to write an article about the noisy family of the
            Prismriver Sisters, but I only recently met with the youngest
            sister, Lyrica Prismriver (Poltergeist) who plays mysterious notes,
            after sending repeated requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start I had an unwaning interest in how she makes these
            strange notes so freely yet aren't supposed to exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today my doubts were answered as I went to verify them through a
            forceful interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the uninitiated, the Prismriver Sisters are comprised of the
            oldest sister, Lunasa Prismriver who plays violin, middle sister,
            Merlin Prismriver who likes the trumpet, and the youngest sister
            Lyrica Prismriver who uses the keyboard. They hold live concerts in
            many places in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the youngest sister, Lyrica, whose keyboard-shaped instrument
            plays unimaginable notes. Illusionary notes that cannot be found in
            nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sound quality is very high, and it can play many notes at the
            distinct intervals. In fact these many faultless notes are its
            speciality.
          </p>
          <p>Nearly everyone who listens to it cannot hear anything else.</p>
          <p>
            &quot;This keyboard itself is like an illusion. Perhaps it could be
            said to be the yuurei of an instrument that plays notes that have
            been lost in the outside world. I don't really understand how it
            makes the notes, but as long it can play them, there's no
            problem. For notes as well as instruments, for them to be lost and
            become illusion, if they are lost in the this world, they become
            yuurei. My notes are the notes of illusions, the notes of the other
            world. It makes perfect sense for everyone to want to listen to them
            in this world, yeah?
          </p>
          <p>She was talking about the notes that have greeted death.</p>
          <p>That is to say, yuurei can also play wondrous notes.</p>
          <p>
            These very mysterious notes like the blowing of horns and drum beats
            give expressions like spoken words but cannot be heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if they should be called the yuurei of notes, these notes are
            like the notes people would listen to in this world a long time ago.
            However, they didn't know the reason why these notes cannot be
            heard today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the notes the girl plays are said to be notes that have
            greeted death in the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>These illusionary notes must also exist in that world too.</p>
          <p>
            So to speak, these noisy ghost-like notes live at the highest point
            of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there is nothing else that symbolizes the yuurei of notes like
            the keyboard.

          </p>
          <p>
            Because I can stir the emotions of people through notes that nobody
            has ever heard.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>But you still have no idea how those notes are made, right?</p>

            >
          </p>
          <p>That's not necessary at all.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only approve of the remarkability of the notes after we
            approve your services.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span

          </p>
          <p>
            So you're saying you want to know how the notes are made? How
            about the notes of thunder, the notes of the wind rustling through
            the trees, the notes of cicadas chirping? I bet you can't
            explain a single one.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Explaining those is... difficult.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Right? That's the making of the notes is more remarkable than
            the person who uses them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Remarkable?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            It was common for notes from some time ago to be made in nature,
            correct? That's why nature is remarkable. If I were to use those
            kinds of notes it wouldn't be remarkable at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>So the question is if your notes are remarkable?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Notes not from nature, illusionary notes. Sounds not of this world,
            sounds that have greeted death. There's no one else who can use
            those kinds of notes. That's why I'm remarkable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Remarkable indeed. By the way, about these illusionary notes, how
            did you come to be able to use them?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You mean how I became a noisy ghost? A Poltergeist? It's only
            natural I can use them. If I didn't use them it would be
            unnatural.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's just how it is, huh? I don't think I'm
            satisfied with that answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            There's more to us than simply being noisy ghosts. It's more
            like we are ghosts of noisiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>So death is noisiness too?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The noisiness is the sound of living things. It's the notes of
            feelings, emotions, and mood swings. The noisiness comes from an
            explosion of emotions from the living. By this noisiness alone, we
            able to support ourselves as poltergeists. Isn't that
            remarkable?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I'm sorry, but that's not really remarkable.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            From my sisters' changing moods I can combine that with my own
            remaining emotions and express it as a song. The emotions are linked
            through dreams, and me and my sisters can create the noisiness of
            living things. The living call the music we create the music of
            ghosts, ghost songs. Remarkable, isn't it?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            When people who play music talk about difficult concepts every word
            starts to blur. Your sisters have nothing on you when it comes to
            talking about difficult subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            That's because our notes are our life. It really isn't that
            hard to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It may be easy for you, but I have a much harder time with it.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lyrica</span></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;So you can't enjoy music unless you can understand it? If
            you don't understand the notes you're hearing it doesn't
            lift your spirits? You can't decide if the skill of a musical
            group is great or not and you never talk about songs? I can't
            imagine how small the entrance into a heart like that must be...
            That's almost like a human's.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, you're absolutely correct. Hearts can be moved by music, and
            noise is the best kind of music.
