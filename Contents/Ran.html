            />On X month X day, the mathematics magician calculated the width of
            the Sanzu River, surprising related parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sanzu River is the river which flows between this world and the
            next.
          </p>
          <p>
            This river isn't fixed in width; rather, it is famous for extreme
            length changes according to various factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, calculating the width of the river has been
            understood to be impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mathematics magician who accomplished this feat is Ran Yakumo
            (Shikigami).
          </p>
          <p>
            She's usually strong with numbers, being able to answer complicated
            equations instantly, startling those around her.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked why she had the thought to calculate the width of the
            Sanzu River, she simply replied that it was to kill some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            While our readers may wonder about width of the Sanzu River, to
            understand the equations, one would need some degree of specialized
            knowledge. For that reason, this article will not go into the
            details of the expressions.
          </p>
          <p>I suggest those interested ask her directly.</p>
          <p>It generally goes like this:</p>
          <p>
            The Sanzu River is not a normal river, but one that carries away the
            past.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why the actual length is different from the observed length.
            It is necessary to know the histories of the deceased to calculate
            that distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The breadth of the river, depending on the person, can take either a
            short instant to cross or an infinitely long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans may not know what factor determines this, but it has been
            said to be the ferryman's fee.
          </p>
          <p>The more you pay the ferryman, the shorter the distance.</p>
          <p>
            Plotting the curve of this inversely proportional function, we see
            that the closer to 0 you pay the ferryman, the closer the distance
            approaches infinity; the more you pay, the closer the distance
            approaches 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, wealth in the other world is not the same thing as wealth in
            the present world; humans cannot bring their fortune from this world
            to the next when they die.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why it seems the amount of the payment is determined by
            other factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here on, the calculations take into account factors such as the
            histories of the deceased, where several thousand expressions are
            needed to solve the equation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if they are successfully calculated, the results are so
            complicated, nobody is able to prove them.
          </p>
          <p>
            With no way to find out if it is correct, I don't think this is of
            the slightest use.

          <p>
            Hmmm. I haven't seen such a grandly useless feat in a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>Didn't I already mention that I did this out of boredom?</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>But you are really good with mathematics, unlike me.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>Here, an equation of a thousand expressions.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Ack!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>And here is the proof.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Ughhhhh.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;I'm a shikigami, so such things come naturally to me.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...Do you always think of such things when bored?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I try to calculate things like how many particles it would take to
            blanket Gensokyo with mist or how long it would take to reach the
            North Star.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>You must always be really bored.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've got time to rot away, since Miss Yukari is sleeping all the
            time....
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Is this what you meant when you said shikigami are good with
            numbers?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to numbers, equations themselves are shikigami. Just
            as equations that neither diverge nor converge produce an infinite
            number of useful solid objects, so do the equations Miss Yukari uses
            make my power invincible. I therefore act as the equations tell me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's how it is. I don't think I could keep making
            pre-determined actions. It'd be too constricting.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Ran </span></p>
          <p>
            Even if you could fly many times faster than you do now? Even if you
            could become many times stronger?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Speed means nothing if it's decided for me. Flying free is what has
            meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>Even if you could land many times more scoops?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Ngh!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>...Do you want me to make you my shikigami?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Please spare me....wait, aren't you a shikigami yourself?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a shikigami, but I can also use shikigami. I'm controlling one
            right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's surprising.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If it weren't so, then you wouldn't know the reason I determined the
            width of the Sanzu, would you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, I see - since you use a shikigami, you're good with equations,
            which means that even as you're run by equations, you're also
            controlling them...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            You think up a new formula, and you create a formula that will solve
            it. So your master...is better at numbers than you are?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It goes without saying that there is no comparison. I could neither
            solve nor understand Miss Yukari's equations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>How terrifying....</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Ran</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Miss Yukari would determine not only the Sanzu's width but also the
            depth of the bottom of Avici. She'd find out how long it would take
            Ursa Major to devour the North Star, all in an instant. Normally all
            she does is sleep, but the instant she opens her mouth, she gives
            orders no one else would think up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This conversation's gone into a whole other dimension. So there are
            still youkai around with that much power...
