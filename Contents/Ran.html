		X month X day, the mathematics magician calculated the width of the Sanzu 
		River, surprising related parties.</p>
		<p>The Sanzu River is the river which flows between this world and the next.</p>
		<p>This river isn&#39;t fixed in width; rather, it is famous for extreme length 
		changes according to various factors.</p>
		<p>Because of this, calculating the width of the river has been understood 
		to be impossible.</p>
		<p>The mathematics magician who accomplished this feat is Ran Yakumo (Shikigami).</p>
		<p>She&#39;s usually strong with numbers, being able to answer complicated equations 
		instantly, startling those around her.</p>
		<p>When asked why she had the thought to calculate the width of the Sanzu 
		River, she simply replied that it was to kill some time.</p>
		<p>While our readers may wonder about width of the Sanzu River, to understand 
		the equations, one would need some degree of specialized knowledge. For 
		that reason, this article will not go into the details of the expressions.</p>
		<p>I suggest those interested ask her directly.</p>
		<p>It generally goes like this:</p>
		<p>&quot;The Sanzu River is not a normal river, but one that carries away the 
		past.</p>
		<p>This is why the actual length is different from the observed length. 
		It is necessary to know the histories of the deceased to calculate that 
		distance.</p>
		<p>The breadth of the river, depending on the person, can take either a 
		short instant to cross or an infinitely long time.</p>
		<p>Humans may not know what factor determines this, but it has been said 
		to be the ferryman&#39;s fee.</p>
		<p>The more you pay the ferryman, the shorter the distance.</p>
		<p>Plotting the curve of this inversely proportional function, we see that 
		the closer to 0 you pay the ferryman, the closer the distance approaches 
		infinity; the more you pay, the closer the distance approaches 0.&quot;</p>
		<p>Also, wealth in the other world is not the same thing as wealth in the 
		present world; humans cannot bring their fortune from this world to the 
		next when they die.</p>
		<p>That is why it seems the amount of the payment is determined by other 
		factors.</p>
		<p>From here on, the calculations take into account factors such as the 
		histories of the deceased, where several thousand expressions are needed 
		to solve the equation.</p>
		<p>Even if they are successfully calculated, the results are so complicated, 
		nobody is able to prove them.</p>
		<p>With no way to find out if it is correct, I don&#39;t think this is of the 
		slightest use.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>This is correct, you know?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hmmm. I haven&#39;t seen such a grandly useless feat in a long time.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Didn&#39;t I already mention that I did this out of boredom?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But you are really good with mathematics, unlike me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Here, an equation of a thousand expressions.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Ack!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And here is the proof.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Ughhhhh.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;I&#39;m a shikigami, so such things come naturally to me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...Do you always think of such things when bored?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I try to calculate things like how many particles it would take to blanket 
		Gensokyo with mist or how long it would take to reach the North Star.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>You must always be really bored.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve got time to rot away, since Miss Yukari is sleeping all the time....</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is this what you meant when you said shikigami are good with numbers?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>When it comes to numbers, equations themselves are shikigami. Just as 
		equations that neither diverge nor converge produce an infinite number of 
		useful solid objects, so do the equations Miss Yukari uses make my power 
		invincible. I therefore act as the equations tell me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So that&#39;s how it is. I don&#39;t think I could keep making pre-determined 
		actions. It&#39;d be too constricting.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Even if you could fly many times faster than you do now? Even if you 
		could become many times stronger?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Speed means nothing if it&#39;s decided for me. Flying free is what has meaning.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Even if you could land many times more scoops?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ngh!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...Do you want me to make you my shikigami?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Please spare me....wait, aren&#39;t you a shikigami yourself?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m a shikigami, but I can also use shikigami. I&#39;m controlling one right 
		now.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s surprising.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If it weren&#39;t so, then you wouldn&#39;t know the reason I determined the 
		width of the Sanzu, would you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, I see - since you use a shikigami, you&#39;re good with equations, which 
		means that even as you&#39;re run by equations, you&#39;re also controlling them...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>You think up a new formula, and you create a formula that will solve 
		it. So your master...is better at numbers than you are?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It goes without saying that there is no comparison. I could neither solve 
		nor understand Miss Yukari&#39;s equations.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How terrifying....</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ran</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Miss Yukari would determine not only the Sanzu&#39;s width but also the depth 
		of the bottom of Avici. She&#39;d find out how long it would take Ursa Major 
		to devour the North Star, all in an instant. Normally all she does is sleep, 
		but the instant she opens her mouth, she gives orders no one else would 
		think up.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This conversation&#39;s gone into a whole other dimension. So there are still 
		youkai around with that much power... </p>
