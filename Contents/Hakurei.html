          <p>The Hakurei Shrine.</p>
          <p>
            Deep within the mountains, seperated from the human village,
            Gensokyo's only occupied shrine can be found situated on the border
            between Gensokyo and the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, while this shrine does have a connection to Gensokyo, it's
            not a particularly close one.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't have a close connection with the outside world either.
            This shrine's location is on the very border.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people are fascinated by the cherry blossoms that bloom here in
            the spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            But because of the personality of the shrine maiden that lives here,
            many youkai and evil spirits gather at the shrine. Those are always
            the kind of beings that assemble here.
          </p>
          <p>For this reason, very few normal humans visit the shrine.</p>
          <p>
            The shrine maiden seems to attract youkai to the shrine, and as a
            result of this, the humans aren't. Quite ironic.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, this isn't a place where we youkai can relax either.</p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, we have to compete with the moderately strong human who
            lives here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine has no role other than maintaining the border between
            Gensokyo and the outside world. This is no longer a place to worship
            the gods, so those who find sacred areas difficult to deal with have
            no problem here.
          </p>
          <p>
            When one comes to visit the shrine, they should not bring offerings,
            but food or spirits would be preferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of which, the shrine maiden will likely ask to borrow some
            during the cherry blossom season.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter the time, there will always be someone there, so going
            there to drink in peace is not recommended.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of now, Gensokyo and the outside world are completely cut off
            from each other because of the Hakurei Shrine.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, compared to the Hakurei Shrine from before, it was not the
            brilliant shrine it is now, and I remember that it was unable to
            perform its functions at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess that from the outside world, the Hakurei Shrine is probably
            still seen as the dull, small shrine it was a long time ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The youkai who visit the shrine now enjoy the colorful shrine, but
            at the same time, they might miss the good old days.
