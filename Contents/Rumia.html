            />Lately, a small darkness has been appearing during the afternoons
            of midsummer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Light doesn't pass through this darkness, it just stains it black
            and continues on its way through Gensokyo's fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            This small lump of darkness only prevents light from reaching it, it
            does not have any physical effect on anything that touches it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true identity of this darkness is the youkai of darkness, Rumia
            (youkai).
          </p>
          <p>
            She abolishes the light around her, which prevents revealing her
            form and seeing outside from the darkness.
          </p>
          <p>I questioned Rumia herself as to why she was doing this.</p>
          <p>
            Because the sunlight is all hot in the summer and I don't like it.
            By avoiding sunlight like this, I can get past the heat too. If I'm
            surrounded by darkness, it's always summer night. Summer nights feel
            really good, you know?
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding what effect it can have to be surrounded in darkness all
            day, I decided to ask an expert familiar with the details of living
            while avoiding sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aah. There's no way it can have a positive effect on the plants that
            are in the darkness together as well. Even if it's only a single
            day, there will be an effect. The youkai inside? Well yes, there's
            no effect on the youkai. On the contrary, there are more youkai that
            are weak to sunlight. If they can get by without being exposed to
            sunlight, then they'd do so. Reading books indoors is the absolute
            best for a bright and clear day like today. (Owner of Kourindou)
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent any negative effects on plants, I cautioned the youkai of
            darkness that it might be better to not stay in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumia does not appear to have a reason for creating darkness, other
            than avoiding heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those weak against sunlight, if you see darkness moving across
            the plains, it may be a good idea to take a break inside.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>An objective article on you.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You know, lately there's been a lot of weird youkai coming into my
            summer resort paradise. That's never happened before, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you kept floating around like that, you might've been regarded as
            something dangerous and consequently attacked, so I wrote an article
            on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Buut. If more things come into the darkness it gets hotter, doesn't
            it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Then inviting an ice fairy in might make it cooler.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Seems cold...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way, it's too dark and I can't see very well. Could you make
            it a bit brighter?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What're you saying, I've already let a little light in so I could
            read this piece of paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's too dark around me and I can't read my notebook. I can't take
            notes either.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Aah, geez, if I let even a little light in it gets really bright.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But to think I really can't see anything outside at all. It's a bit
            difficult to tell where we're flying.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Of course you can't. We can't see after all.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Eh?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I bump into trees all the time, but that just goes to show what
            darkness is all about.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you just floating about without any specific destination in
            mind?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously. It's too dark to see, so it's the same no matter where I
            go.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's because of you that it's too dark to see.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Ooh, is that so~?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That is so~. By the way, why do you hate sunlight so much?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>You don't hate it?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy both afternoon when humans are active, and night when youkai
            are active. I have no troubles with articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's rare. When I'm out in the sunlight, my skin gets all rough
            and I can't think, and my hair gets all messy and I get split ends,
            and in the end I get really sleepy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I think that's because you're lacking something.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But I'm fine in moonlight. I don't need to make any darkness at
            night and it's bright.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You seem to fly around aimlessly in the afternoon, but what do you
            do at night?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Nothing much. I just fly around at night too.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            So a lifestyle without any real goal in mind. Lately, it feels like
            there are more youkai who don't feel like learning or working. It's
            quite depressing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Attacking humans is a youkai's job.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>But are you exerting any effort in attacking humans?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Rumia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately, humans won't let me attack them. This other time I was
            beaten up instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's because of that that you can't uphold your dignity as a youkai.
            At the very least, you should meld into the darkness at night and
            position yourself at a road.
          </p>
