		a small darkness has been appearing during the afternoons of midsummer.</p>
		<p>Light doesn&#39;t pass through this darkness, it just stains it black and 
		continues on its way through Gensokyo&#39;s fields.</p>
		<p>This small lump of darkness only prevents light from reaching it, it 
		does not have any physical effect on anything that touches it.</p>
		<p>The true identity of this darkness is the youkai of darkness, Rumia (youkai).</p>
		<p>She abolishes the light around her, which prevents revealing her form 
		and seeing outside from the darkness.</p>
		<p>I questioned Rumia herself as to why she was doing this.</p>
		<p>&quot;Because the sunlight is all hot in the summer and I don&#39;t like it. By 
		avoiding sunlight like this, I can get past the heat too. If I&#39;m surrounded 
		by darkness, it&#39;s always summer night. Summer nights feel really good, you 
		know?&quot;</p>
		<p>Regarding what effect it can have to be surrounded in darkness all day, 
		I decided to ask an expert familiar with the details of living while avoiding 
		sunlight.</p>
		<p>&quot;Aah. There&#39;s no way it can have a positive effect on the plants that 
		are in the darkness together as well. Even if it&#39;s only a single day, there 
		will be an effect. The youkai inside? Well yes, there&#39;s no effect on the 
		youkai. On the contrary, there are more youkai that are weak to sunlight. 
		If they can get by without being exposed to sunlight, then they&#39;d do so. 
		Reading books indoors is the absolute best for a bright and clear day like 
		today.&quot; (Owner of Kourindou)</p>
		<p>To prevent any negative effects on plants, I cautioned the youkai of 
		darkness that it might be better to not stay in one place.</p>
		<p>Rumia does not appear to have a reason for creating darkness, other than 
		avoiding heat.</p>
		<p>For those weak against sunlight, if you see darkness moving across the 
		plains, it may be a good idea to take a break inside.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What&#39;s this piece of paper?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>An objective article on you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You know, lately there&#39;s been a lot of weird youkai coming into my summer 
		resort paradise. That&#39;s never happened before, though.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you kept floating around like that, you might&#39;ve been regarded as 
		something dangerous and consequently attacked, so I wrote an article on 
		it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Buut. If more things come into the darkness it gets hotter, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Then inviting an ice fairy in might make it cooler.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Seems cold...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>By the way, it&#39;s too dark and I can&#39;t see very well. Could you make it 
		a bit brighter?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What&#39;re you saying, I&#39;ve already let a little light in so I could read 
		this piece of paper.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s too dark around me and I can&#39;t read my notebook. I can&#39;t take notes 
		either.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Aah, geez, if I let even a little light in it gets really bright.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But to think I really can&#39;t see anything outside at all. It&#39;s a bit difficult 
		to tell where we&#39;re flying.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Of course you can&#39;t. We can&#39;t see after all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Eh?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I bump into trees all the time, but that just goes to show what darkness 
		is all about.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Are you just floating about without any specific destination in mind?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Obviously. It&#39;s too dark to see, so it&#39;s the same no matter where I go.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s because of you that it&#39;s too dark to see.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ooh, is that so~?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That is so~. By the way, why do you hate sunlight so much?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You don&#39;t hate it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I enjoy both afternoon when humans are active, and night when youkai 
		are active. I have no troubles with articles.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s rare. When I&#39;m out in the sunlight, my skin gets all rough and 
		I can&#39;t think, and my hair gets all messy and I get split ends, and in the 
		end I get really sleepy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I think that&#39;s because you&#39;re lacking something.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But I&#39;m fine in moonlight. I don&#39;t need to make any darkness at night 
		and it&#39;s bright.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem to fly around aimlessly in the afternoon, but what do you do 
		at night?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Nothing much. I just fly around at night too.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>So a lifestyle without any real goal in mind. Lately, it feels like there 
		are more youkai who don&#39;t feel like learning or working. It&#39;s quite depressing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Attacking humans is a youkai&#39;s job.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But are you exerting any effort in attacking humans?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Lately, humans won&#39;t let me attack them. This other time I was beaten 
		up instead.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s because of that that you can&#39;t uphold your dignity as a youkai. 
		At the very least, you should meld into the darkness at night and position 
		yourself at a road.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rumia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Eeeh, what a pain. </p>
