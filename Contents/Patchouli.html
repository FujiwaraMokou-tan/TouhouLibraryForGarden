            />Month X, day X: Even though summer is approaching, an
            out-of-season Setsubun festival was held at the Scarlet Devil
            Mansion at the bank of the lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because there are no oni in Gensokyo, Setsubun hasn't been
            celebrated in a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, the event called Setsubun is also unknown among the
            maids.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find out why Setsubun festival has been held again so suddenly, I
            decided to find someone in the midst of the excitement who could
            tell me.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scarlet Devil Mansion was already filled with roasted beans.
            Someone said to throw them at people's shadows and chaos ensued.
            That's how it started.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mistress of Scarlet Devil Mansion, Remilia Scarlet (vampire),
            preferred not to partake in the bean throwing, instead eating the
            Maki rolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those roasted beans are pretty useless. You burn your hand when you
            pick them up... Everyone threw them all in bunches because it looked
            like fun. After that, I forbade them to throw at me. When a bean
            hits you it really feels like a burn.
          </p>
          <p>The one planning this event was Patchouli Knowledge (witch).</p>
          <p>
            I asked her why she arranged this out-of-season Setsubun festival so
            suddenly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of season? What are you saying? Is there a specific season for
            Setsubun? When spring ends and summer begins, this time is surely
            not for Setsubun. This year we decided to try to strengthen measures
            against the oni, and Setsubun is the first measure. We have
            sufficient materials for Setsubun, although I'm dubious of the fine
            details. However, the fundamental thing is to throw beans, which I'm
            letting the maids do. (Patchouli)
          </p>
          <p>
            I then inquired why she so suddenly decided to carry out a
            counter-measure plan against the oni.
          </p>
          <p>
            It helps to be preventive, and the Hall of Devils can be raided
            during peace-addled times. But I shouldn't be revealing all of our
            reasons, correct?
          </p>
          <p>The Scarlet Devil Mansion seems peace-addled enough.</p>
          <p>
            A long time has already passed since the Oni withdrew from Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way, this mystical Setsubun celebration is to prevent the
            oni from returning to Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>This is something we tengu are sure will happen.</p>
          <p>
            Currently, we tengu are the ones most involved in the oni matter.

          <p>It must have been.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            At least I had decided from the start to prohibit it in the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought you were a little too honest. Really, if said 2 or 3 times
            before that there were oni outside, that should've been enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>Hmmmm... But there aren't many that managed to get in.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You should be worried if you are mistaken if you run into one.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, because the maids associate with the oni, things will
            be settled quickly. Actually, Remi can't touch the beans so she was
            unable do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It seems vampires are also weak against roasted beans.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Remi was rather bored by the events, as she only accepted eating the
            Maki rolls.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </</p>
          <p>That really doesn't have much to do with oni...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</
          </p>
          <p>You seem to know a great deal about Setsubun. Why is that?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A long time ago, tengu and oni were friendly with each other. That's
            why we know the most about anything relating to the oni, such as
            Setsubun, in all of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>If so, do you understand why you throw beans to drive out oni?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You've heard of things like the five phases or the Demon Gate...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            No, that's not it. You've also been affected by the humans'
            distorted interpretations.
          </p>
          <p>The truth is amazingly simple.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Huh?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a play that the oni decided, a satire against humans. The
            aspect Oni hates most about humans is the lying, so they brought
            roasted beans with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Was that the case?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The act of scattering the beans was originally connected to making
            buds grow as an act of farming.
          </p>
          <p>
            By setting fire to the beans beforehand, no sprouts would emerge
            from the soil. Which means that the humans were merely performing a
            false act of farming... and...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So when you scatter the beans it's like you're saying, I don't know
            if I'm a human, but I am a liar~..
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            So perhaps from the start, in order for the humans to be able to
            exterminate themselves, the oni decided on their own weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span>
          </p>
          <p>Why did they need to do something like that?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            That is because the power was too strong. Even though they have a
            genuine fatal weakness, before it could be discovered the oni made
            up some their own. Even though they're almost the strongest beings,
            they certainly have a strange weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            And the vampire's weakness to roasted beans, maybe it was just to
            hide her weakness to sunlight?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know of any camouflage to sunlight, except for perhaps a
            parasol for walks outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You are also unexpectedly weak to sunlight. It doesn't look like
            you've been outside for a long time.
