		X, day X: Even though summer is approaching, an out-of-season Setsubun festival 
		was held at the Scarlet Devil Mansion at the bank of the lake.</p>
		<p>Because there are no oni in Gensokyo, Setsubun hasn&#39;t been celebrated 
		in a long time.</p>
		<p>For that reason, the event called Setsubun is also unknown among the 
		maids.</p>
		<p>To find out why Setsubun festival has been held again so suddenly, I 
		decided to find someone in the midst of the excitement who could tell me.</p>
		<p>The Scarlet Devil Mansion was already filled with roasted beans. Someone 
		said to throw them at people&#39;s shadows and chaos ensued. That&#39;s how it started.</p>
		<p>The mistress of Scarlet Devil Mansion, Remilia Scarlet (vampire), preferred 
		not to partake in the bean throwing, instead eating the Maki rolls.</p>
		<p>&quot;Those roasted beans are pretty useless. You burn your hand when you 
		pick them up... Everyone threw them all in bunches because it looked like 
		fun. After that, I forbade them to throw at me. When a bean hits you it 
		really feels like a burn.&quot;</p>
		<p>The one planning this event was Patchouli Knowledge (witch).</p>
		<p>I asked her why she arranged this out-of-season Setsubun festival so 
		suddenly.</p>
		<p><br>
		&quot;Out of season? What are you saying? Is there a specific season for Setsubun? 
		When spring ends and summer begins, this time is surely not for Setsubun. 
		This year we decided to try to strengthen measures against the oni, and 
		Setsubun is the first measure. We have sufficient materials for Setsubun, 
		although I&#39;m dubious of the fine details. However, the fundamental thing 
		is to throw beans, which I&#39;m letting the maids do.&quot; (Patchouli)</p>
		<p>I then inquired why she so suddenly decided to carry out a counter-measure 
		plan against the oni.</p>
		<p>&quot;It helps to be preventive, and the Hall of Devils can be raided during 
		peace-addled times. But I shouldn&#39;t be revealing all of our reasons, correct?&quot;</p>
		<p>The Scarlet Devil Mansion seems peace-addled enough.</p>
		<p>A long time has already passed since the Oni withdrew from Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>In this way, this mystical Setsubun celebration is to prevent the oni 
		from returning to Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>This is something we tengu are sure will happen.</p>
		<p>Currently, we tengu are the ones most involved in the oni matter.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But the fact is that they certainly were here.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is that so? That&#39;s certainly a lost person&#39;s illusion, isn&#39;t it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Certainly a lost person.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is throwing beans around really effective?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The cleaning afterward was terrible.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It must have been.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>At least I had decided from the start to prohibit it in the library.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I thought you were a little too honest. Really, if said 2 or 3 times 
		before that there were oni outside, that should&#39;ve been enough.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hmmmm... But there aren&#39;t many that managed to get in.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You should be worried if you are mistaken if you run into one.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s fine, because the maids associate with the oni, things will be 
		settled quickly. Actually, Remi can&#39;t touch the beans so she was unable 
		do it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It seems vampires are also weak against roasted beans.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Remi was rather bored by the events, as she only accepted eating the 
		Maki rolls.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>That really doesn&#39;t have much to do with oni...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem to know a great deal about Setsubun. Why is that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A long time ago, tengu and oni were friendly with each other. That&#39;s 
		why we know the most about anything relating to the oni, such as Setsubun, 
		in all of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If so, do you understand why you throw beans to drive out oni?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;ve heard of things like the five phases or the Demon Gate...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, that&#39;s not it. You&#39;ve also been affected by the humans&#39; distorted 
		interpretations.</p>
		<p>The truth is amazingly simple.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Huh?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It was a play that the oni decided, a satire against humans. The aspect 
		Oni hates most about humans is the lying, so they brought roasted beans 
		with them.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Was that the case?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The act of scattering the beans was originally connected to making buds 
		grow as an act of farming.</p>
		<p>By setting fire to the beans beforehand, no sprouts would emerge from 
		the soil. Which means that the humans were merely performing a false act 
		of farming... and...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So when you scatter the beans it&#39;s like you&#39;re saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
		if I&#39;m a human, but I am a liar~.&quot;.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So perhaps from the start, in order for the humans to be able to exterminate 
		themselves, the oni decided on their own weakness.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
		</p>
		<p>Why did they need to do something like that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That is because the power was too strong. Even though they have a genuine 
		fatal weakness, before it could be discovered the oni made up some their 
		own. Even though they&#39;re almost the strongest beings, they certainly have 
		a strange weakness.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And the vampire&#39;s weakness to roasted beans, maybe it was just to hide 
		her weakness to sunlight?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t know of any camouflage to sunlight, except for perhaps a parasol 
		for walks outside.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You are also unexpectedly weak to sunlight. It doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ve 
		been outside for a long time.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Sunlight damages books and my hair so I detest it. </p>
