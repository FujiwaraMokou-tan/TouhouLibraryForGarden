		a donation collecting scam has been running rampant.</p>
		<p>The trick is very clever, the fraudster would go from home to home, going 
		&quot;I&#39;ve come to collect offerings for the shrine&quot; in broad daylight.</p>
		<p>Humans and youkai, thinking that it would be nice to donate to the shrine, 
		were all unwittingly caught in the scam.</p>
		<p>However, neither did the ones who donated think it was a scam, nor did 
		anyone come forward as a victim. Thus it is currently not considered a crime.</p>
		<p>We successfully contacted the donations schemer in her tracks.</p>
		<p>The schemer is Tewi Inaba (Youkai rabbit).</p>
		<p>This is what she has to say about her scam:</p>
		<p>&quot;It&#39;s not a scam! Aren&#39;t donations things that make good things happen, 
		even if they are little offerings? Then, I can promise that at the moments 
		they see me~&quot;</p>
		<p>It is said that she has the ability to bring a little good fortune to 
		whoever she meets.</p>
		<p>This is why the ones who had their money taken didn&#39;t realize it until 
		the end.</p>
		<p>Also, we&#39;ve interviewed the victims of this scam to see what they have 
		to say.</p>
		<p>&quot;Donations? Yeah, I wondered when the shrine had started coming around 
		to collect money, but it looked so pitiful so I donated some.&quot; (Ms. S, Human)</p>
		<p>&quot;Ah, it seemed interesting so I donated some, ze. Just a little though.&quot; 
		(Ms. M, Human)</p>
		<p>&quot;So what&#39;s a donation?&quot; (Ms. A, Magician)</p>
		<p>It seems that there are no qualms about the donation.</p>
		<p>In the midst of this, the shrine&#39;s miko Reimu Hakurei, being the keeper 
		of genuine donations, said this:</p>
		<p>&quot;What the heck, the shrine&#39;s donation box gets only leaves, why does 
		that fake one get money?! And why didn&#39;t anyone complain about this?! Wouldn&#39;t 
		the shrine&#39;s reputation get hurt if things go on like this?&quot;</p>
		<p>It&#39;s hard to imagine that anything would happen if you put money into 
		the shrine&#39;s donation box, but if you put money into the fraudulent donation 
		box, you might become a little luckier.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s no wonder why nobody complained.</p>
		<p>Maybe it&#39;s time to reconsider the role of donations.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s a clever donation scam you pulled there.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Mmmm. I told you it&#39;s not a scam~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>But you were lying and cheating their money, and you say that&#39;s not a 
		scam?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Fine, it doesn&#39;t matter if you call it a scam. But you know? I have a 
		big policy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A policy?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That is, I don&#39;t lie just for my own fortune, it&#39;s for theirs too. If 
		you want bring good fortune to someone, you&#39;ve got to lie.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t condone lies. I only write articles about truth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Eh, that&#39;s wonderful. But who gains by that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s not about loss or gain.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I think it&#39;s about loss or gain, though. Who loses with a well-intentioned 
		lie? Even if they know it&#39;s a lie it&#39;s not like they&#39;re gonna get angry, 
		they might even thank me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But lying itself is bad.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem unlikely to donate to me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I won&#39;t be fooled so easily, you know.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Ah, that&#39;s too bad. Even if you donate a little, a small blessing would 
		be waiting for you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s not possible.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Didn&#39;t you see the happy faces on the people who donated? Well...it&#39;s 
		not the type of luck that can change someone&#39;s life, but can&#39;t you feel 
		there is a little luck in them?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>....</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Mah, that&#39;s my ability. The fact that there is luck is itself not a lie.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...How much money is &quot;a little&quot;?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s the thought that matters.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh oohh, almost got fooled there. But well...it might be interesting 
		to donate just a little bit, even if I get fooled.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Here you go, the donation box of good fortune.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m donating, but I know I&#39;m being tricked, okay?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Luck would visit those whose thoughts weigh heavier.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t need that much luck, I&#39;m lucky enough as I am now.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Good for you then. But if you donate you definitely will be a little 
		luckier, I think.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t believe it for one bit, but that&#39;s great.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;d definitely get involved into something big when you go home.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Is that...supposed to be a good thing?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A good thing, isn&#39;t it. Well, rather than a good thing, it&#39;s more like 
		something that makes you lucky.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s certainly something that makes me lucky...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You can&#39;t fault me for lying when you find luck where incidents happen.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s a harsh thing to say.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tewi </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Lastly, I&#39;ll say something true for the first time. Most of what I said 
		was lies, right from the very beginning.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>!? Right from the very beginning? </p>
