            />Recently, a donation collecting scam has been running rampant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick is very clever, the fraudster would go from home to home,
            going I've come to collect offerings for the shrine in broad
            daylight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans and youkai, thinking that it would be nice to donate to the
            shrine, were all unwittingly caught in the scam.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, neither did the ones who donated think it was a scam, nor
            did anyone come forward as a victim. Thus it is currently not
            considered a crime.
          </p>
          <p>We successfully contacted the donations schemer in her tracks.</p>
          <p>The schemer is Tewi Inaba (Youkai rabbit).</p>
          <p>This is what she has to say about her scam:</p>
          <p>
            It's not a scam! Aren't donations things that make good things
            happen, even if they are little offerings? Then, I can promise that
            at the moments they see me~
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that she has the ability to bring a little good fortune
            to whoever she meets.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why the ones who had their money taken didn't realize it
            until the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, we've interviewed the victims of this scam to see what they
            have to say.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donations? Yeah, I wondered when the shrine had started coming
            around to collect money, but it looked so pitiful so I donated some.
            (Ms. S, Human)
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, it seemed interesting so I donated some, ze. Just a little
            though. (Ms. M, Human)
          </p>
          <p>So what's a donation? (Ms. A, Magician)</p>
          <p>It seems that there are no qualms about the donation.</p>
          <p>
            In the midst of this, the shrine's miko Reimu Hakurei, being the
            keeper of genuine donations, said this:
          </p>
          <p>
            What the heck, the shrine's donation box gets only leaves, why does
            that fake one get money?! And why didn't anyone complain about
            this?! Wouldn't the shrine's reputation get hurt if things go on
            like this?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's hard to imagine that anything would happen if you put money
            into the shrine's donation box, but if you put money into the
            fraudulent donation box, you might become a little luckier.
          </p>
          <p>It's no wonder why nobody complained.</p>
          <p>Maybe it's time to reconsider the role of donations.</p>

          </p>
          <p>That's a clever donation scam you pulled there.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>Mmmm. I told you it's not a scam~</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            But you were lying and cheating their money, and you say that's not
            a scam?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Fine, it doesn't matter if you call it a scam. But you know? I have
            a big policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>A policy?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That is, I don't lie just for my own fortune, it's for theirs too.
            If you want bring good fortune to someone, you've got to lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I don't condone lies. I only write articles about truth.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>Eh, that's wonderful. But who gains by that?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's not about loss or gain.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it's about loss or gain, though. Who loses with a
            well-intentioned lie? Even if they know it's a lie it's not like
            they're gonna get angry, they might even thank me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>But lying itself is bad.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>You seem unlikely to donate to me.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I won't be fooled so easily, you know.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi </span></p>
          <p>
            Ah, that's too bad. Even if you donate a little, a small blessing
            would be waiting for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's not possible.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Didn't you see the happy faces on the people who donated?
            Well...it's not the type of luck that can change someone's life, but
            can't you feel there is a little luck in them?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>....</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Mah, that's my ability. The fact that there is luck is itself not a
            lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...How much money is a little?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's the thought that matters.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh oohh, almost got fooled there. But well...it might be interesting
            to donate just a little bit, even if I get fooled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>Here you go, the donation box of good fortune.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I'm donating, but I know I'm being tricked, okay?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>Luck would visit those whose thoughts weigh heavier.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I don't need that much luck, I'm lucky enough as I am now.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi </span></p>
          <p>
            Good for you then. But if you donate you definitely will be a little
            luckier, I think.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I don't believe it for one bit, but that's great.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You'd definitely get involved into something big when you go home.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Is that...supposed to be a good thing?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A good thing, isn't it. Well, rather than a good thing, it's more
            like something that makes you lucky.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's certainly something that makes me lucky...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can't fault me for lying when you find luck where incidents
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's a harsh thing to say.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tewi </span></p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I'll say something true for the first time. Most of what I
            said was lies, right from the very beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>!? Right from the very beginning?</p>
