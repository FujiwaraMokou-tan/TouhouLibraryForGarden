            />X Day X Month - A severe incident of unknown cause has created
            tension throughout Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is considerably long night without a hint of dawn, and the moon
            has stopped moving across the sky as well.
          </p>
          <p>All this on the night of a full moon.</p>
          <p>
            There are few beings in Gensokyo who are not affected by the full
            moon.
          </p>
          <p>Because of this, madness is now spreading throughout Gensokyo.</p>
          <p>
            The cause and movite are completely unknown, and because of her
            stubbornness to fight in these situations, I've decided to move
            before waiting for the shrine maiden to do so, to see Gensokyo's
            nervousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, no matter the location, due to being unable to tell the
            exact time because of the momentary interruption in the movement of
            the full moon, there is no telling how fast it will move when it
            starts again, or if the sun will rise without a similar problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            What anyone would gain from stopping time during the night, as well
            as how to resolve the problem, will remain a mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            I heard rumors that the shrine maiden went on a rampage again, and
            due to her sudden willingness to resolve the indicent, I regret that
            I was unable to observe her movements.
          </p>
          <p>However, I'm still concerned about something.</p>
          <p>
            That is to say, is there a youkai that would benefit from stopping
            the movement of the moon?
          </p>
          <p>
            Is there anyone other than youkai who would do something like this?
            Maybe I should think about any humans would do something like this
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is said that nights are long during the fall, but that night was
            too long.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the youkai whose motto is that fun can be found in any kind of
            situation were irritated by this severe incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't think of anyone who would have been the culprit behind that
            incident though. And what kind of power would they have possessed to
            be able to so something like that?
          </p>
          <p>And, is there any need to actively pursue it?</p>
          <p>
            Again, while gathering data, I heard an especially interesting
            rumor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moon on the night of the endless night and the moon on the night
            the next day were completely different.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were very slight, but the color and the light were both
            different. Also, the energy that the moon radiated was different as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>Perhaps, on that day, the moon might have been reborn</p>
          <p>
            Time was needed for the ceremony of reincarnation, so the moon that
            night needed to be stopped.
          </p>
          <p>Thinking about it in that way, it's no wonder.</p>
          <p>
            If that's the case, that incident wasn't the doings of youkai, but
            it might have been natural phenomenon of the real moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certainly, it is unlikely that the youkai who are easily influenced
            by the moon would able to think to stop it so easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I should have considered it to be an act of the real moon, and not
            of those who become influenced by it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, if the rumors of the shrine maiden's rampage are true, I find
            her arbitrary actions to be rather rash, just like during the other
            incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            To handle a dangerous incident on that scale in the same simple
            manner as before was extremely hazardous.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to quickly investigate the root of the problem
            first.

            Many were hoping to welcome the harvest moon in autumn, but the
            actual full moon was slightly different.
          </p>
          <p>
            The major youkai were troubled by this moon that had lost it's
            power, and they worked together with humans, who weren't aware of
            the incident at all, to find the missing real moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stopping a night like this, until the true full moon is returned to
            Gensokyo...
