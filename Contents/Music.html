          Whenever you see a picture of delicious-looking food, you can almost
          smell and taste it as well. As the sense of smell and the sense of
          taste are imagined by the mind, they are both true and false. Thinking
          about it this way, music is more than just something that comes from
          sound. If music is something that can shape a world, by contrast, it
          is something that can also recall memories. When you talk about music,
          it is absolutely essential to talk about these senses as well. The
          illusion that there are none who never get the wrong impression is
          just that, an illusion. In this article, I have written whatever I can
          remember about the illusions I saw when I composed these
          songs.However, my inability to write well about my older days is also
          just an illusion.

          I went through a lot of distress to make this song- which is a
          shooting game song, most of which tend to be serious and dark- into a
          song that gives off an energetic, refreshing feeling. Shooting games
          have a number of cool, pop, and dance music-styled songs in them, but
          there are is a surprising lack of cheery songs. This song resembles a
          fantastic eastern sky with no shadows, just like a hallucination of
          seeing paradise right before you. By the way, this song is titled
          Shanghai Teahouse because when I first starting making Touhou Koumakyo
          (EoSD), it was titled Touhou Kochakan (Teahouse). This song made such
          an impression on me, that I used the game's title as the song's name
          too. However, the game's title ended up not matching the story, so I
          changed it.

          Since I felt like I'd discovered a new self, I thought it would be
          nice to write a song that's a little different than usual. If you just
          listen to the intro, it gives off a dandy feeling that's suited to
          cigarettes, but when you get to the main part it's pretty much the
          same as usual, very like me. I can remember writing that I wanted to
          make a really cool song this time. I think if I tried redoing this
          song, it would come out really great. But, that would be too much of a
          pain. This image gives me a vision of a town where rain is quietly
          falling. In fact, this is a song that lets me imagine the existence of
          humans, which is rare. Even the Forest of Dolls from the title kind of
          feels like an old, ruined human village. Well, since it's my old self,
          I guess I can't be too certain...

          When I wrote this song, I designed it to start out as eerie and slowly
          become more and more courageous. Something like going to a graveyard
          in the middle of the night on a dare, except it's no ordinary dare.
          It's a dare given to those who truly believe they are mingling with
          the Netherworld, like they become wandering spirits themselves... The
          part of this song that leaves the most of an impression is the cute
          yet courageous hook. It's like imagining mysterious girls dancing
          among a gravesite with no tombstones. If you think of it that way,
          even the intro with the ghostly sounds (as I call them) also sounds
          cute. The sounds that most ghosts seem to make are like
          Whooooooooooooo, and that's my image of them as well. I think that
          even hearing the sounds of ghosts in the rain would resonate clearly.

          A song that tries really hard to get the climax to the climax. This
          song's theme is simply my image for Remilia Scarlet. Mysteriously, as
          the game heads towards the final stage, the songs start having smaller
          and narrower themes. But with this song, it just keeps developing as
          it progresses. When I listen to this song, I see the illusion of a
          game. It makes me feel like I'm playing an illusionary game. No genre
          in particular, and I don't understand why it does, but it just makes
          me feel like I'm playing some kind of game. I especially like the
          piano in the second half of the hook. When I was writing the song, its
          tension just kept rising and let that energy carry me to the end.
          Nothing wrong with that, right?

          I thought about making this song the theme for one of the members of
          the Sealing Club, Merry. Not because Merry's a magician or anything
          like that, but I thought it would make a lot of sense. This song makes
          me imagine an occult investigation club at a juvenile school. The
          feeling like they're playing house somewhere is irresistable. The song
          itself also feels like I could use it in a game, and despite the fact
          that it's on this CD, I think it is a very Touhou-like song. There's a
          strange sound that can be heard behind the song. I put it in there
          because I think that an occult investigation club would meet in the
          science room, and that seemed like a science room-ish sound. But
          what's a science room-ish sound anyway?

          An oriental-styled fantasy piece with a melody that sounds like you've
          heard it before, but somehow forgotten about. Actually, I think this
          piece sounds very cute. The piano's melody expresses ephemerality, and
          the wind instrument's melody feels like something you'd hear at a
          childrens' festival. Young children and customs passed down through
          history come together in a very cute and ephemeral way. Although it's
          hard to say if ephemeral things are cute (maybe if they are jumping
          around). Since this song doesn't feel very dark or heavy, any
          unplesant feelings would be completely removed after listening to it,
          if you had any to begin with. I think it's that kind of song.

          I really don't... understand this song very well. I don't remember
          much from when I was composing it. But I am certain that main part of
          the song is the reverberation in the ending (for about 3 minutes). I
          enjoyed the ending reverberation so much that I don't think much about
          the intro or the melody. This song really doesn't make me see anything
          until the ending reverberations. At that part, it's a very desolate
          feeling, as if there were only memories of something remaining. Even
          for these comments, because I didn't write about this song immediately
          after I composed it, I can't recall anything about my mental state at
          that time. However, judging by just the song's title and the song
          itself, being able to listen to it from an objective viewpoint is
          rather interesting.

          These articles about how we adapt to composing various styles of music
          were written by the kannushi of the Hakurei Shrine, who wrote these

          it accurately, if you cut out everything that's a lie, it's almost too

            (Song from Immaterial and Missing Power)
          </span>

          This song feels like it has an amazing sense of speed. Among all the
          final boss themes for the games I've made until now, I am satisfied in
          saying that this is the cutest one. While it feels fast, the fact that
          the main melody is also very simple makes it feel nice. In this song,
          it feels like the world is no longer becoming any wider, and no matter
          where you go, it feels very lonely. A feeling that everything pleasant
          in the world is falling apart into thin pieces. I think that's where
          the song's Missing Power comes from. But if you just take the intro,
          and change the weight of the sound, it's concerning how it becomes a
          much heavier piece. Even now, I might not even be too sure about what
          to make of it. But I guess it's suitable for that rambunctious brat
          (rude) of a last boss.

          I conceived of the Sealing Club as a circle that would carve out the
          world from a different angle from the games. If I didn't give them a
          theme song, the characters I took the time to create wouldn't feel
          alive, so I wrote this song. A theme song needs to be cool. That's
          what I say. (biased) That's why I made it as cool as I possibly could
          and made it catchy and fashionable. When I listen to this song, I see
          visions of cool piano playing. It's the kind of song you play while
          drinking alcohol. I think it's a good idea for songs with cool piano
          parts have a smooth rhythm and a single, defined direction. You just
          have to forget the notion that following this theory will produce a
          bad song.

          I was enthusiastic to make a song so suspicious-sounding that others
          would be unable to cope with it, and this song also feels rather
          calming and Touhou-like. I found PCB to be calming overall, and it had
          a lot of songs that were important to the scenery, but at around this
          point in the game I shifted tracks to a more This is a shmup, so shoot
          things. feeling. When I listen to this song, I feel a strong force
          that exhausts my physical energy. It's just with this song that I may
          not see things in the present. The illusions I see are both from the
          present and the future. Necro- means death. The fantastic world of the
          dead. The fantastic world that only reveals itself at the time of
          death. That is why this song has no feelings of the past. There needs
          to be a song like that where you can feel the present.

          While I always speak of illusions, I want to make it clear that this
          is a realistic song. I made this song to tie up the CD. If you don't
          have a song like that at the end, then I fear that the CD will end on
          an uneasy note. Having illusions from the beginning to the end is
          overdoing it, so it needs to feel like it returns to reality at some
          point. However, because this song was meant to return the listener to
          reality, I think the song itself has little power. As I don't see any
          major illusions either, the image of it being a just a normal song is
          strong. Still, a CD needs a long like this.

          Strange Bird is Renko, who is represented by the fast first half of
          the song. The Mysterious Cat is Merry, who is represented by the
          strange rhythms in the second half. It's almost like riding a bird
          flying through a city at night, or almost like a drunken cat
          staggering through the city. That was the intent I had in mind when I
          wrote this song. If you don't understand the theme, the song makes no
          sense when you listen to it. To be honest, this song is meant for
          nothing but my own self-satisfaction, so I wonder if it's okay to just
          put it on a CD. I still like it, though.

          I tried hard to write this song to express the idea of This is
          certainly the Japan that Japanese people saw. For some songs that are
          said to be pure, traditional Japanese music, I don't really think they
          were completely made in a Japanese manner. The way Japanese people see
          history starting to rebuild itself, they see that the present and the
          past are beginning to seperate. Actually, I think that they should be
          looking more at what happens naturally wherever Japanese people are
          using modern methods. Right now, I think of this song as a Japanese
          song. It doesn't necessarily need to have a shamisen or a bamboo
          flute, and it doesn't use a Japanese musical scale, that's just what
          it is. Whenever I hear songs like this, I feel the illusion that I'm
          grateful to have been born in Japan. Uh, illusion? No, no, don't get
          the wrong impression now.

          I think that Hourai is a keyword that will show up even in later
          Touhou works, but this is when I first came up with and used it in the
          title of the first song on my first music CD. Yes, I decided on the
          name first, and then wrote the song based on that image. This is a
          quiet song that is scary, yet calm. I don't think I've written
          anything like this one lately... Probably because I've got nothing but
          shmups on the brain now. Well, I guess it's just my narrowing outlook,
          but sometimes I feel like I can't go back to the more general Touhou
          mindset. This was the first original song on the CD that I wrote
          comments for, so I feel it is especially precious. I would re-write
          the comments in a number of ways, I think it helped me improve a lot
          so I am very grateful for that.

          While I am someone who has yet to actually see Kaguya-hime, this song
          was not meant to represent The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, but rather
          what happens after the story ends. The messengers from the moon who
          reveal themselves only on nights of the full moon, and the ones they
          oppose, the humans on Earth. But those from the moon reach their wits'
          end and lose the will to fight. That's when the bamboo on Earth begins
          to glow... and the moon princess appears, that is, Kaguya-hime. Kaguya
          troubles the humans, and one man decides to fight her. My image for
          this song is nothing that off-the-wall. It's more of the moon that was
          said to exist in Japan's sky a long time ago, and the princesses that
          fly through that sky. Of course, they still haven't lost their playful
          spirit, just like how some people still enjoy retro games. As I also
          want my songs to remain in people's minds decades from now, I will
          continue to do my best.

          Somehow, this song has an unthinkable amount of darkness and heaviness
          compared to the songs in my games now. While I can envision something
          when I listen to most recent Touhou songs, with this song, there's no
          background to speak of. It's just darkness. I don't like writing songs
          like this now, so I want to know what kind of mental state I was in
          when I wrote this song. However, because almost all of the piano in
          this song doesn't conjure any particular image, I think that I
          intended for it to set the rhythm. Listening to it now, it feels like
          it's meant to tie everything together, but it increasingly loses
          control. It's easy to imagine why I don't understand if it was a good
          idea.

          The Science Era is a song that doesn't really feel like the future.
          That's natural, because the phrase itself doesn't sound that old. In
          actuality, this song is trying to exhibit a more complex theme, a song
          for those who miss the Science Era. I rather like this song myself.
          Boys and girls that wear retro clothes, and a world that immerses
          itself in an occult pseudoscience. That's the kind of things this song
          makes me envision. Nothing bright by any means, but it's an unusually
          positive world with sepia-toned science. I might as well say that it
          has a nostalgic feel to it. However, whenever I reminisce, it's mostly
          about things like sounds or melodies. I might even do this with my own
          songs that I write in the future.

          This is an extremely catchy song. While that may be because it is a
          new song, it is also very close to my own envisioning of Touhou. A
          naturally girly cuteness, a feeling of giddiness, an Japanese oriental
          style, and for a shooting game that also never lets up, I think a song
          like this every now and then is a good idea (Kind of like other
          people's problems). Yes, I used to play trumpet and I still own one
          now. I think trumpet-playing for this kind of song is pretty cool. By
          the way, the trumpet has the main part because it's a wind instrument.

          I want to point out that the song's title and theme have a story. The
          song itself plays the part of the border, because the border itself
          has been sealed away in the song. So it's a duplex barrier. The intro
          represents sensing dreams, while the main melody represents the sense
          of reality. So, what about the song? It doesn't make me feel anything
          in particular, but for songs with that kind of meaning, as long as the
          meaning is understood, it's enjoyable. On the other hand, it means
          that the illusions in the song are very unbalanced.

          This was the most difficult song for me to write out of everything
          I've written so far. I guess you could say it's because it's my own
          theme. It's like the theme song that plays when you make your entrance
          on a talk show, so writing this song was somewhat embarrassing. I
          think I inadvertantly did a good job on this song. But it's too grand
          and too cute, so there's no way it could be my theme song. For some
          reason, when I was writing the main melody I ended up humming
          Yumeta-ga-e, Yumeta-ga-e along with it, so I used that for the title
          of the CD (&#22818; (yume) &#36949; (tagae)). I was actually going to
          title this song &#22818;&#36949;&#35251;&#38899; (Yumetagae Kannon,
          The Buddhist diety of mercy in a different dream), but I didn't want
          to have that title for my theme song, so I changed it.

          A song with a similar mindset to Plain Asia, but this song's melody
          and the sounds I used are more conspicuously Japanese. This is an
          original, Touhou-style reinterpretation of the traditional
          Kagome-Kagome that every Japanese person knows. While it wasn't
          composed in the same time period, I think that it's just as powerful
          as Touryanse, making them the two major fantasy children's songs.
          While the similarities end there, they both seem to have unfading
          power. I wanted to see how much I could fool around with the song
          without reducing that power. I think that's a good way to demonstrate
          how powerful they are. By the way, Cinderella is a foreign fairy tale.

          This song is completely opposite from the CD's first song, Kid's
          Festival. I wanted to make a fantastical melody with the piano. I
          think there are people who have noticed, but on the Changeability of
          Strange Dream album, I was trying to tell a story through the songs.
          The rearranged pieces represent dreams, and the original songs
          represent the real world. The part of this song that leaves the most
          impression on me is the hook, which is fairly serious, so listening to
          this after listening to Kid's Festival is a little tough. Whenever I
          do, it makes me think Merry's dreams are kind of nightmarish, huh?

          The title screen songs all have the same general theme, so saying that
          they all sound familiar is unnecessary. You don't even have to think
          about it the first time you hear them. But they aren't different
          arrangements, and they don't have the same melody note for note. It's
          simply just because the atmospheres they create are the same. To get
          in the right frame of mind in creating a title theme, I think it's a
          good idea to avoid any unpleasant feelings and don't make the player
          lose their head. These aren't hard-and-fast rules, but I prefer to
          have a gentle push into the game.

          This is probably the most realistic song in Dolls in Pseudo Paradise.
          It doesn't really have any fantastical parts (excluding the piano
          solo), so it doesn't feel like I could use it in a game except for the
          credits, but I think it has the right qualities for the final song on
          a music CD. Or that's how I appraised it back when I made it. However,
          I'm a little concerned with myself since this song doesn't make me
          visualize much at all. Maybe it's a fault of the song being too
          realistic, but I don't know if that's really the whole problem. In
          particular, I have no idea what made me come up with the title of this
          song. I think the shrine maiden mentioned in the title is Reimu. It's
          Reimu, but I didn't write down what exactly made me imagine her in
          this song. I suppose that my past self valued this song a little too
          highly. Yes.

          I wanted a song in PCB to show that there was a different atmosphere
          between the worlds up to stage 4 and from stage 5 on. This is the
          result of that, and I'm rather satisfied with it. Rather than tell a
          story, this song helps establish the setting. When you listen to a
          song like this, you more or less feel like you're there. Although for
          this song, I was trying to create the image of An extremely beautiful
          place that does not exist here. When I listen to this song, I see
          visions of ancient Japan as if it never changed and still existed
          today. I don't think this was by chance, but it is certainly an
          illusion. There are many impressive songs that I name after the game
          it appears in. This is another of those songs.

          EoSD is the 6th game in the Touhou series, but in many ways it was a

          imagine there are a lot of oriental things in this game, so I'll make
          the first one not very oriental. This song is a result of that.
          Listening to this song creates a rather suspenseful feeling. While
          each person will have their own feelings on it, it still sounds very
          unstable with its rhythmic repeating melody. I intentionally placed
          that eeriness in this song. It might be a good idea for me to make
          this kind of song occasionally. The only problem is that it really
          doesn't fit the optimistic attitude of the lot in Gensokyo right now.

          Making songs for non-shooting games gives me a number of problems, but
          making this one for whatever reason was a little too normal. This is
          the theme for that troublesome youkai, Yukari Yakumo. That's why I
          arranged this song as if it had a boundary so there are so images. On
          the first half of the boundary, there's an ominous feeling, and on the
          second, a more pleasant feeling. I particularly like the feel of how
          fast the POV changes when it enters the pleasant side. When I listen
          to this song, I rapidly envision a field of sight over a shrine in the
          evening. If you listen to it, you'll immediately know it's a Touhou
          song, but somehow it feels different from the others. This isn't a
          theory; there is a difference in the illusionary component of this
          song. It's the effect of my change in mindset making a song for a
          non-shooting game.
