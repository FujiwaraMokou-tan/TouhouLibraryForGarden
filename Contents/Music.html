		Whenever you see a picture of delicious-looking food, you can almost smell 
		and taste it as well.<br>
		As the sense of smell and the sense of taste are imagined by the mind, they 
		are both true and false.<br>
		<br>
		Thinking about it this way, music is more than just something that comes 
		from sound. If music is something that can shape a world, by contrast, it 
		is something that can also recall memories. When you talk about music, it 
		is absolutely essential to talk about these senses as well. The illusion 
		that there are none who never get the wrong impression is just that, an 
		illusion.<br>
		<br>
		In this article, I have written whatever I can remember about the illusions 
		I saw when I composed these songs.However, my inability to write well about 
		my older days is also just an illusion.<br>

		I went through a lot of distress to make this song- which is a shooting 
		game song, most of which tend to be serious and dark- into a song that gives 
		off an energetic, refreshing feeling. Shooting games have a number of cool, 
		pop, and dance music-styled songs in them, but there are is a surprising 
		lack of cheery songs.<br>
		<br>
		This song resembles a fantastic eastern sky with no shadows, just like a 
		hallucination of seeing paradise right before you. By the way, this song 
		is titled Shanghai Teahouse because when I first starting making Touhou 
		Koumakyo (EoSD), it was titled Touhou Kochakan (Teahouse). This song made 
		such an impression on me, that I used the game&#39;s title as the song&#39;s name 
		too. However, the game&#39;s title ended up not matching the story, so I changed 
		it.<br>

		<br>
		Since I felt like I&#39;d discovered a new self, I thought it would be nice 
		to write a song that&#39;s a little different than usual. If you just listen 
		to the intro, it gives off a dandy feeling that&#39;s suited to cigarettes, 
		but when you get to the main part it&#39;s pretty much the same as usual, very 
		like me.<br>
		<br>
		I can remember writing that I wanted to make a really cool song this time. 
		I think if I tried redoing this song, it would come out really great. But, 
		that would be too much of a pain.<br>
		<br>
		This image gives me a vision of a town where rain is quietly falling. In 
		fact, this is a song that lets me imagine the existence of humans, which 
		is rare. Even the Forest of Dolls from the title kind of feels like an old, 
		ruined human village. Well, since it&#39;s my old self, I guess I can&#39;t be too 
		certain...<br>

		<br>
		When I wrote this song, I designed it to start out as eerie and slowly become 
		more and more courageous. Something like going to a graveyard in the middle 
		of the night on a dare, except it&#39;s no ordinary dare. It&#39;s a dare given 
		to those who truly believe they are mingling with the Netherworld, like 
		they become wandering spirits themselves...<br>
		<br>
		The part of this song that leaves the most of an impression is the cute 
		yet courageous hook. It&#39;s like imagining mysterious girls dancing among 
		a gravesite with no tombstones. If you think of it that way, even the intro 
		with the ghostly sounds (as I call them) also sounds cute.<br>
		<br>
		The sounds that most ghosts seem to make are like &quot;Whooooooooooooo&quot;, and 
		that&#39;s my image of them as well. I think that even hearing the sounds of 
		ghosts in the rain would resonate clearly.<br>

		A song that tries really hard to get the climax to the climax. This song&#39;s 
		theme is simply my image for Remilia Scarlet. Mysteriously, as the game 
		heads towards the final stage, the songs start having smaller and narrower 
		themes. But with this song, it just keeps developing as it progresses.<br>
		<br>
		When I listen to this song, I see the illusion of a game. It makes me feel 
		like I&#39;m playing an illusionary game. No genre in particular, and I don&#39;t 
		understand why it does, but it just makes me feel like I&#39;m playing some 
		kind of game.<br>
		<br>
		I especially like the piano in the second half of the hook. When I was writing 
		the song, its tension just kept rising and let that energy carry me to the 
		end. Nothing wrong with that, right?<br>

		I thought about making this song the theme for one of the members of the

		<br>
		This song makes me imagine an occult investigation club at a juvenile school. 
		The feeling like they&#39;re playing house somewhere is irresistable. The song 
		itself also feels like I could use it in a game, and despite the fact that 
		it&#39;s on this CD, I think it is a very Touhou-like song.<br>
		<br>
		There&#39;s a strange sound that can be heard behind the song. I put it in there 
		because I think that an occult investigation club would meet in the science 
		room, and that seemed like a science room-ish sound. But what&#39;s a science 
		room-ish sound anyway?<br>

		An oriental-styled fantasy piece with a melody that sounds like you&#39;ve heard

		very cute. The piano&#39;s melody expresses ephemerality, and the wind instrument&#39;s 
		melody feels like something you&#39;d hear at a childrens&#39; festival.<br>
		<br>
		Young children and customs passed down through history come together in 
		a very cute and ephemeral way. Although it&#39;s hard to say if ephemeral things 
		are cute (maybe if they are jumping around).<br>
		<br>
		Since this song doesn&#39;t feel very dark or heavy, any unplesant feelings 
		would be completely removed after listening to it, if you had any to begin

		I really don&#39;t... understand this song very well. I don&#39;t remember much

		is the reverberation in the ending (for about 3 minutes). I enjoyed the 
		ending reverberation so much that I don&#39;t think much about the intro or 
		the melody.<br>
		<br>
		This song really doesn&#39;t make me see anything until the ending reverberations. 
		At that part, it&#39;s a very desolate feeling, as if there were only memories 
		of something remaining.<br>
		<br>
		Even for these comments, because I didn&#39;t write about this song immediately

		This song feels like it has an amazing sense of speed. Among all the final

		that this is the cutest one. While it feels fast, the fact that the main 
		melody is also very simple makes it feel nice.<br>
		<br>
		In this song, it feels like the world is no longer becoming any wider, and 
		no matter where you go, it feels very lonely. A feeling that everything 
		pleasant in the world is falling apart into thin pieces. I think that&#39;s 
		where the song&#39;s &quot;Missing Power&quot; comes from.<br>
		<br>
		But if you just take the intro, and change the weight of the sound, it&#39;s 
		concerning how it becomes a much heavier piece. Even now, I might not even

		I conceived of the Sealing Club as a circle that would carve out the world

		this song. A theme song needs to be cool. That&#39;s what I say. (biased) That&#39;s 
		why I made it as cool as I possibly could and made it catchy and fashionable.<br>
		<br>
		When I listen to this song, I see visions of cool piano playing. It&#39;s the 
		kind of song you play while drinking alcohol. I think it&#39;s a good idea for 
		songs with cool piano parts have a smooth rhythm and a single, defined direction. 
		You just have to forget the notion that following this theory will produce 
		a bad song.<br>

		I was enthusiastic to make a song so suspicious-sounding that others would

		I found PCB to be calming overall, and it had a lot of songs that were important 
		to the scenery, but at around this point in the game I shifted tracks to 
		a more &quot;This is a shmup, so shoot things.&quot; feeling.<br>
		<br>
		When I listen to this song, I feel a strong force that exhausts my physical

		<br>
		&quot;Necro-&quot; means &quot;death&quot;. The fantastic world of the dead. The fantastic world

		it needs to feel like it returns to reality at some point.<br>
		<br>
		However, because this song was meant to return the listener to reality, 
		I think the song itself has little power. As I don&#39;t see any major illusions 
		either, the image of it being a just a normal song is strong. Still, a CD

		I tried hard to write this song to express the idea of &quot;This is certainly

		pure, traditional Japanese music, I don&#39;t really think they were completely 
		made in a Japanese manner. The way Japanese people see history starting 
		to rebuild itself, they see that the present and the past are beginning 
		to seperate. Actually, I think that they should be looking more at what 
		happens naturally wherever Japanese people are using modern methods.<br>
		<br>
		Right now, I think of this song as a Japanese song. It doesn&#39;t necessarily

		I think that &quot;Hourai&quot; is a keyword that will show up even in later Touhou

		the first song on my first music CD. Yes, I decided on the name first, and

		This is a quiet song that is scary, yet calm. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve written

		The messengers from the moon who reveal themselves only on nights of the

		&quot;The Science Era&quot; is a song that doesn&#39;t really feel like the future. That&#39;s

		Boys and girls that wear retro clothes, and a world that immerses itself

		So, what about the song? It doesn&#39;t make me feel anything in particular, 
		but for songs with that kind of meaning, as long as the meaning is understood, 
		it&#39;s enjoyable. On the other hand, it means that the illusions in the song 
		are very unbalanced.<br>

		<br>
		This was the most difficult song for me to write out of everything I&#39;ve 
		written so far. I guess you could say it&#39;s because it&#39;s my own theme. It&#39;s 
		like the theme song that plays when you make your entrance on a talk show, 
		so writing this song was somewhat embarrassing.<br>
		<br>
		I think I inadvertantly did a good job on this song. But it&#39;s too grand 
		and too cute, so there&#39;s no way it could be my theme song.<br>
		<br>
		For some reason, when I was writing the main melody I ended up humming &quot;Yumeta-ga-e, 
		Yumeta-ga-e&quot; along with it, so I used that for the title of the CD (&#22818; (yume) 
		&#36949; (tagae)). I was actually going to title this song &quot;&#22818;&#36949;&#35251;&#38899;&quot; (Yumetagae Kannon, 
		The Buddhist diety of mercy in a different dream), but I didn&#39;t want to 
		have that title for my theme song, so I changed it.<br>

		<br>
		A song with a similar mindset to Plain Asia, but this song&#39;s melody and 
		the sounds I used are more conspicuously Japanese. This is an original, 
		Touhou-style reinterpretation of the traditional Kagome-Kagome that every 
		Japanese person knows.<br>
		<br>
		While it wasn&#39;t composed in the same time period, I think that it&#39;s just 
		as powerful as Touryanse, making them the two major fantasy children&#39;s songs. 
		While the similarities end there, they both seem to have unfading power. 
		I wanted to see how much I could fool around with the song without reducing 
		that power. I think that&#39;s a good way to demonstrate how powerful they are.<br>
		<br>
		By the way, Cinderella is a foreign fairy tale. Huh? You knew that already?

		<br>
		This song is completely opposite from the CD&#39;s first song, Kid&#39;s Festival. 
		I wanted to make a fantastical melody with the piano. I think there are 
		people who have noticed, but on the Changeability of Strange Dream album, 
		I was trying to tell a story through the songs. The rearranged pieces represent 
		dreams, and the original songs represent the real world.<br>
		<br>
		The part of this song that leaves the most impression on me is the hook, 
		which is fairly serious, so listening to this after listening to Kid&#39;s Festival 
		is a little tough. Whenever I do, it makes me think &quot;Merry&#39;s dreams are 
		kind of nightmarish, huh?&quot;<br>

		<br>
		The title screen songs all have the same general theme, so saying that they 
		all sound familiar is unnecessary. You don&#39;t even have to think about it 
		the first time you hear them. But they aren&#39;t different arrangements, and 
		they don&#39;t have the same melody note for note. It&#39;s simply just because 
		the atmospheres they create are the same.<br>
		<br>
		To get in the right frame of mind in creating a title theme, I think it&#39;s 
		a good idea to avoid any unpleasant feelings and don&#39;t make the player lose 
		their head. These aren&#39;t hard-and-fast rules, but I prefer to have a gentle 
		push into the game.<br>

		<br>
		This is probably the most realistic song in Dolls in Pseudo Paradise. It 
		doesn&#39;t really have any fantastical parts (excluding the piano solo), so 
		it doesn&#39;t feel like I could use it in a game except for the credits, but 
		I think it has the right qualities for the final song on a music CD. Or 
		that&#39;s how I appraised it back when I made it.<br>
		<br>
		However, I&#39;m a little concerned with myself since this song doesn&#39;t make 
		me visualize much at all. Maybe it&#39;s a fault of the song being too realistic, 
		but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really the whole problem.<br>
		<br>
		In particular, I have no idea what made me come up with the title of this 
		song. I think the shrine maiden mentioned in the title is Reimu. It&#39;s Reimu, 
		but I didn&#39;t write down what exactly made me imagine her in this song. I 
		suppose that my past self valued this song a little too highly. Yes.<br>

		I wanted a song in PCB to show that there was a different atmosphere between 
		the worlds up to stage 4 and from stage 5 on. This is the result of that, 
		and I&#39;m rather satisfied with it. Rather than tell a story, this song helps 
		establish the setting. When you listen to a song like this, you more or 
		less feel like you&#39;re there. Although for this song, I was trying to create 
		the image of &quot;An extremely beautiful place that does not exist here&quot;.<br>
		<br>
		When I listen to this song, I see visions of ancient Japan as if it never 
		changed and still existed today. I don&#39;t think this was by chance, but it 
		is certainly an illusion.<br>
		<br>
		There are many impressive songs that I name after the game it appears in. 
		This is another of those songs.<br>

		EoSD is the 6th game in the Touhou series, but in many ways it was a new 
		start. However, I wasn&#39;t sure if I could make too many unexpected changes, 
		but then I thought &quot;With a title like &quot;Touhou&quot;, people will imagine there 
		are a lot of oriental things in this game, so I&#39;ll make the first one not 
		very oriental&quot;. This song is a result of that.<br>
		<br>
		Listening to this song creates a rather suspenseful feeling. While each 
		person will have their own feelings on it, it still sounds very unstable 
		with its rhythmic repeating melody. I intentionally placed that eeriness 
		in this song.<br>
		<br>
		It might be a good idea for me to make this kind of song occasionally. The 
		only problem is that it really doesn&#39;t fit the optimistic attitude of the 
		lot in Gensokyo right now.<br>

		Making songs for non-shooting games gives me a number of problems, but making 
		this one for whatever reason was a little too normal. This is the theme 
		for that troublesome youkai, Yukari Yakumo. That&#39;s why I arranged this song 
		as if it had a boundary so there are so images. On the first half of the 
		boundary, there&#39;s an ominous feeling, and on the second, a more pleasant 
		feeling. I particularly like the feel of how fast the POV changes when it 
		enters the pleasant side.<br>
		<br>
		When I listen to this song, I rapidly envision a field of sight over a shrine 
		in the evening. If you listen to it, you&#39;ll immediately know it&#39;s a Touhou 
		song, but somehow it feels different from the others. This isn&#39;t a theory; 
		there is a difference in the &quot;illusionary component&quot; of this song. It&#39;s 
		the effect of my change in mindset making a song for a non-shooting game.<br>
