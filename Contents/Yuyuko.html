            />I heard reports from the inhabitants of Gensokyo that around 4
            P.M. on Xth the X, a great number of cherry petals lay scattered
            beneath the cherry trees, which had not yet begun to blossom.
          </p>
          <p>
            As petals that have not blossomed cannot fall, I decided to
            investigate the matter further. As a result, I was able to establish
            that the petals were from a type of cherry tree that doesn't grow in
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding this unusual, I decided to keep watch under the cherry
            trees, and after three days I met somebody who seemed a likely
            suspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            That suspect was the mistress of the Netherworld, Yuyuko Saigyouji
            (ghost).
          </p>
          <p>
            When I found her, she was walking together with a servant who was
            carrying a large basket filled with flower petals, which I pointed
            out as implicating them in the current incident. The suspect
            responded thus:
          </p>
          <p>
            You wish to know what we are doing? As you can see, we're returning
            Gensokyo its spring. When we scatter these petals around, these
            cherry petals should bloom right before your eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, when I asked her if there was something special about those
            cherry blossoms, she replied, Of course, they're very special. If we
            spread them around, spring will come to Gensokyo. Saying this, she
            reached into her servant's basket, took some cherry blossoms, and
            threw them into the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blossoms on the cherry trees hadn't opened yet, but the petals
            slowly fluttered to the ground as if spring had visited that spot,
            and the suspect spun about dancing among the falling cherry blossom
            petals.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was extremely hard to understand, but the flower petals she was
            scattering about appeared to be natural flower petals, so it's
            likely there was no inherent danger in this incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spring's coming this year has been late compared to previous years,
            and the cherry blossoms haven't opened yet, leaving all of
            Gensokyo's inhabitants impatient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps this sprightly ghost was impatient for the arrival of
            spring, and thought that she could at least enjoy a fabricated
            spring in that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is still a mystery how she obtained natural cherry
            blossoms, where they were from, and what sort of cherry tree
            produced them.

          <p>
            Oh, this is about me? I was just returning spring. The cherry
            blossoms opened soon after this, didn't they?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            When you say returning... it makes it sound like you borrowed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>I was borrowing it, from that shrine maiden.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine maiden? What did she have to do with this? Hm, that could
            make for another article...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're interested, why not interview me? You can interrogate me
            to your heart's desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>No, thank you.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But, isn't the freshness of the news important for newspaper
            articles? This is too old.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if they're old, interesting things are still interesting. If no
            one reports on them, no one may ever realize the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>But you might let something new and interesting get away.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to learn from the past. You can learn new things by
            examining the old.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>Who are you calling old?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I wasn't talking about you.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>How rude! I'm still a pert young soul!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting back to the matter at hand... why were you scattering about
            those cherry blossoms? I'd like to know the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I agree that the truth is the most interesting thing. And as
            everyone is interested in different things... you could say the
            truth varies, too. For example, these two buns...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Look, now, no changing the subject. I'm asking you about the truth
            behind this matter.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span></p>
          <p>
            My, you're so impatient. What happened last year is ancient history;
            I've already forgotten all about it.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>Weren't you just about to tell me something?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you know the story of Old Man Hanasaka, who made an old, dead
            tree flower by scattering magical ash on it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Old Man Hanasaka?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;How rude. I'm not that old.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>No, we weren't talking about you.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            What I was scattering about were magical flower petals full of love
            and affection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>But that wasn't ash?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>Maybe it was?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't tell me you were trying to make the cherry trees flower by
            scattering cherry blossoms around?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I was returning the spring I borrowed from the shrine maiden, with
            interest. Isn't that what you're supposed to do when you borrow
            things?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            ...In any case, from where did you get those cherry blossoms? There
            weren't any cherry trees in blossom at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yuyuko</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, Gensokyo's cherry trees blossomed after that, didn't they? The
            cherry blossoms were just what I'd borrowed. So, I had to return
            them, of course. By the way, are you going to eat that bun?
          </p>
          <p>
