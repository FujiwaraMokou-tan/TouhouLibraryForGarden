		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: left;" alt="" src="BAiJRYuyuko1.JPG" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">I 
		heard reports from the inhabitants of Gensokyo that around 4 P.M. on Xth 
		the X, a great number of cherry petals lay scattered beneath the cherry 
		trees, which had not yet begun to blossom.</p>
		<p>As petals that have not blossomed cannot fall, I decided to investigate 
		the matter further. As a result, I was able to establish that the petals 
		were from a type of cherry tree that doesn&#39;t grow in Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>Finding this unusual, I decided to keep watch under the cherry trees, 
		and after three days I met somebody who seemed a likely suspect.</p>
		<p>That suspect was the mistress of the Netherworld, Yuyuko Saigyouji (ghost).</p>
		<p>When I found her, she was walking together with a servant who was carrying 
		a large basket filled with flower petals, which I pointed out as implicating 
		them in the current incident. The suspect responded thus:</p>
		<p>&quot;You wish to know what we are doing? As you can see, we&#39;re returning 
		Gensokyo its spring. When we scatter these petals around, these cherry petals 
		should bloom right before your eyes.&quot;</p>
		<p>Then, when I asked her if there was something special about those cherry 
		blossoms, she replied, &quot;Of course, they&#39;re very special. If we spread them 
		around, spring will come to Gensokyo.&quot; Saying this, she reached into her 
		servant&#39;s basket, took some cherry blossoms, and threw them into the air.</p>
		<p>The blossoms on the cherry trees hadn&#39;t opened yet, but the petals slowly 
		fluttered to the ground as if spring had visited that spot, and the suspect 
		spun about dancing among the falling cherry blossom petals.</p>
		<p>It was extremely hard to understand, but the flower petals she was scattering 
		about appeared to be natural flower petals, so it&#39;s likely there was no 
		inherent danger in this incident.</p>
		<p>Spring&#39;s coming this year has been late compared to previous years, and 
		the cherry blossoms haven&#39;t opened yet, leaving all of Gensokyo&#39;s inhabitants 
		impatient.</p>
		<p>Perhaps this sprightly ghost was impatient for the arrival of spring, 
		and thought that she could at least enjoy a fabricated spring in that way.</p>
		<p>However, it is still a mystery how she obtained natural cherry blossoms, 
		where they were from, and what sort of cherry tree produced them.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Oh my, the ghost in this article looks so elegant.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Please don&#39;t talk about yourself like that.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, this is about me? I was just returning spring. The cherry blossoms 
		opened soon after this, didn&#39;t they?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When you say &quot;returning&quot;... it makes it sound like you borrowed it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I was borrowing it, from that shrine maiden.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The shrine maiden? What did she have to do with this? Hm, that could 
		make for another article...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you&#39;re interested, why not interview me? You can interrogate me to 
		your heart&#39;s desire.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, thank you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But, isn&#39;t the freshness of the news important for newspaper articles? 
		This is too old.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Even if they&#39;re old, interesting things are still interesting. If no 
		one reports on them, no one may ever realize the truth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But you might let something new and interesting get away.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s important to learn from the past. You can learn new things by examining 
		the old.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Who are you calling old?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How rude! I&#39;m still a pert young soul!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Getting back to the matter at hand... why were you scattering about those 
		cherry blossoms? I&#39;d like to know the truth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, I agree that the truth is the most interesting thing. And as everyone 
		is interested in different things... you could say the truth varies, too. 
		For example, these two buns...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Look, now, no changing the subject. I&#39;m asking you about the truth behind 
		this matter.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>My, you&#39;re so impatient. What happened last year is ancient history; 
		I&#39;ve already forgotten all about it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Weren&#39;t you just about to tell me something?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Do you know the story of Old Man Hanasaka, who made an old, dead tree 
		flower by scattering magical ash on it?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Old Man Hanasaka?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;How rude. I&#39;m not that old.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, we weren&#39;t talking about you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What I was scattering about were magical flower petals full of love and 
		affection.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But that wasn&#39;t ash?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Maybe it was?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Don&#39;t tell me you were trying to make the cherry trees flower by scattering 
		cherry blossoms around?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I was returning the spring I borrowed from the shrine maiden, with interest. 
		Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re supposed to do when you borrow things?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...In any case, from where did you get those cherry blossoms? There weren&#39;t 
		any cherry trees in blossom at the time.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuyuko</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, Gensokyo&#39;s cherry trees blossomed after that, didn&#39;t they? The 
		cherry blossoms were just what I&#39;d borrowed. So, I had to return them, of 
		course. By the way, are you going to eat that bun?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Honestly! This doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll make a good article. Please speak 
		so people can understand you from now on! </p>
