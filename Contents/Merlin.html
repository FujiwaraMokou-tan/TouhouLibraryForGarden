		<img style="width: 300px; height: 304px; float: left;" alt="" src="BAiJRMerlin1.JPG" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">This 
		article is about the recent actions of the Prismriver Sister&#39;s middle sister, 
		Merlin Prismriver (poltergeist).</p>
		<p>She plays the trumpet in their ensemble, but she feels that it&#39;s time 
		to separate from the group.</p>
		<p>There are places, graveyards in particular, from where many ghosts can 
		be summoned. This time I went to get total coverage on this issue.</p>
		<p>She went by herself to a graveyard and gave a refined trumpet performance.</p>
		<p>The ghosts had been in the graveyard for many nights.</p>
		<p>These ghosts also had different personalities.</p>
		<p>Among these were people who had died holding on to grudges and regrets.</p>
		<p>She went to perform by herself multiple times, especially for those who 
		died by committing suicide.</p>
		<p>Unlike a number of times performing with her sisters, her performance 
		used sounds with a rich expression.</p>
		<p>The mood was much lighter than the ghosts expected it to be, and it ran 
		throughout the graveyard.</p>
		<p>It seemed as if her trumpet were controlling the ghosts, rallying them 
		like an army.</p>
		<p>I asked her for the reason behind her actions.</p>
		<p>&quot;Even though the three of us play violin, trumpet, and keyboard, the 
		sound of each instrument has a different part. With my older sister&#39;s gentle 
		songs, the listener&#39;s mood is calmed from the sounds of depression. My intense 
		songs can transform feelings, and the listener&#39;s mood is uplifted from the 
		sounds of mania. Lyrica brings those two ends together into an ear-achingly 
		good song with the sound of illusion. If one of these elements are lacking, 
		then the music would run wild, as if it were magic. On the other hand, for 
		these ghosts of people who commited suicide, driving them crazy in a good 
		way helps them out, so I&#39;m the only one who needs to perform. If we were 
		dealing with insane people, my older sister would be a good choice, and 
		while Lyrica wouldn&#39;t be particularly effective, there shouldn&#39;t be a problem... 
		so basically any one person doing whatever they want is fine, yeah?&quot;</p>
		<p>It seems there is no difference in sound between the music and the performer 
		in this case.</p>
		<p>It is surprising there are those who understand how to use music to change 
		the condition of those who listen to these sounds.</p>
		<p>Certainly, when it is needed, the rich expressions of her solo trumpet 
		performance can change the mood so quickly, it is impossible to listen to 
		it calmly.</p>
		<p>This time, while I was listening to her performance for collecting data, 
		my mood improved so much I almost turned over a tombstone.</p>
		<p>For normal people suddenly encountering these three girls performing 
		together, not listening may possibly be the best idea.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Saying people shouldn&#39;t listen to our performance is so mean!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But my intended meaning was that there was too much danger. Even someone 
		as calm and collected as myself got carried high and away listening to you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Your intended meaning was mute; you absolutely didn&#39;t say they were good 
		sounds. I have no interest in sounds that don&#39;t stir the heart. My sounds 
		are emotional sounds in the first place, and the spinning of my trumpet 
		is like an amplifier for those emotions.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So it spins, huh? Just like you.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How rude. I don&#39;t go &quot;that&quot; far, but I try to enjoy everyday a little 
		bit.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Sounds like fun. So this is just another extension of your sister&#39;s normal 
		actions.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Normally we&#39;re a lot noisier. While it does get loud whenever there are 
		three girls together, it&#39;s not because we&#39;re talking, but because we&#39;re 
		practicing. Whoever is the loudest wins! Isn&#39;t it amazing how we all think 
		like that? Don&#39;t just take my word for it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You say &quot;wins&quot;, so your normal lifestyle is always a matter of winning 
		and losing?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s one problem with our moods, I guess.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So your older sister loses the most? That&#39;s what I think, but she is 
		the most mature out of you all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>When my older sister gets loud, she REALLY gets loud. Her noisiness level 
		is quite high, around the level of breaking glass.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>As expected of a poltergeist. By the way, about the article on your solo 
		performance, did the ghosts of</p>
		<p>those who committed suicide all go to the next world?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Maybe they did, maybe they didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know if they were set free 
		from whatever caused them to kill themselves.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Maybe that&#39;s what happened.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I didn&#39;t really perform to lead dead spirits into the next world. It 
		was only to give ghosts who still had lingering attachments to this world 
		a little bit of fun. I thought it would be a good idea to let forget their 
		all-too-short life with some exciting songs. But to say one more thing, 
		it was my sisters who told me to do it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Your sisters must really enjoy live performances to be planning them 
		so often.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, it was because I lost to my sister before.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So winning and losing has nothing to do with your mood.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I was only kidding!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Now that I think of it, during your solo performance, I wasn&#39;t expecting 
		you to perform with instruments besides the trumpet. Why did you play other 
		instruments?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If I only play the trumpet, I&#39;m limited to playing the melody. Being 
		able to play as many instruments as I want to as the same time sure is handy. 
		I played the trombone, which spun less than the trumpet, the tuba, which 
		spun more than the trumpet, and the horn, which spun much more than the 
		trumpet. And there were many others too.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Your instruments set the standard for spinning, huh?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>When I think about getting others excited, I try to play just enough 
		to do that. That&#39;s why I play spinning instruments.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I think that when you perform, you yourself spin just as much.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merlin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s exciting, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, exciting enough for me. </p>
