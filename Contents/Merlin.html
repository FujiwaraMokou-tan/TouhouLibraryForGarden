            />This article is about the recent actions of the Prismriver
            Sister's middle sister, Merlin Prismriver (poltergeist).
          </p>
          <p>
            She plays the trumpet in their ensemble, but she feels that it's
            time to separate from the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are places, graveyards in particular, from where many ghosts
            can be summoned. This time I went to get total coverage on this
            issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            She went by herself to a graveyard and gave a refined trumpet
            performance.
          </p>
          <p>The ghosts had been in the graveyard for many nights.</p>
          <p>These ghosts also had different personalities.</p>
          <p>
            Among these were people who had died holding on to grudges and
            regrets.
          </p>
          <p>
            She went to perform by herself multiple times, especially for those
            who died by committing suicide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a number of times performing with her sisters, her
            performance used sounds with a rich expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mood was much lighter than the ghosts expected it to be, and it
            ran throughout the graveyard.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed as if her trumpet were controlling the ghosts, rallying
            them like an army.
          </p>
          <p>I asked her for the reason behind her actions.</p>
          <p>
            Even though the three of us play violin, trumpet, and keyboard, the
            sound of each instrument has a different part. With my older
            sister's gentle songs, the listener's mood is calmed from the sounds
            of depression. My intense songs can transform feelings, and the
            listener's mood is uplifted from the sounds of mania. Lyrica brings
            those two ends together into an ear-achingly good song with the
            sound of illusion. If one of these elements are lacking, then the
            music would run wild, as if it were magic. On the other hand, for
            these ghosts of people who commited suicide, driving them crazy in a
            good way helps them out, so I'm the only one who needs to perform.
            If we were dealing with insane people, my older sister would be a
            good choice, and while Lyrica wouldn't be particularly effective,
            there shouldn't be a problem... so basically any one person doing
            whatever they want is fine, yeah?
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems there is no difference in sound between the music and the
            performer in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is surprising there are those who understand how to use music to
            change the condition of those who listen to these sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certainly, when it is needed, the rich expressions of her solo
            trumpet performance can change the mood so quickly, it is impossible
            to listen to it calmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, while I was listening to her performance for collecting
            data, my mood improved so much I almost turned over a tombstone.
          </p>
          <p>
            For normal people suddenly encountering these three girls performing
            together, not listening may possibly be the best idea.
          </p>

          <p>Saying people shouldn't listen to our performance is so mean!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But my intended meaning was that there was too much danger. Even
            someone as calm and collected as myself got carried high and away
            listening to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your intended meaning was mute; you absolutely didn't say they were
            good sounds. I have no interest in sounds that don't stir the heart.
            My sounds are emotional sounds in the first place, and the spinning
            of my trumpet is like an amplifier for those emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>So it spins, huh? Just like you.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            How rude. I don't go that far, but I try to enjoy everyday a little
            bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sounds like fun. So this is just another extension of your sister's
            normal actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally we're a lot noisier. While it does get loud whenever there
            are three girls together, it's not because we're talking, but
            because we're practicing. Whoever is the loudest wins! Isn't it
            amazing how we all think like that? Don't just take my word for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You say wins, so your normal lifestyle is always a matter of winning
            and losing?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's one problem with our moods, I guess.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So your older sister loses the most? That's what I think, but she is
            the most mature out of you all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            When my older sister gets loud, she REALLY gets loud. Her noisiness
            level is quite high, around the level of breaking glass.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            As expected of a poltergeist. By the way, about the article on your
            solo performance, did the ghosts of
          </p>
          <p>those who committed suicide all go to the next world?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. I don't know if they were set
            free from whatever caused them to kill themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Maybe that's what happened.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span></p>
          <p>
            I didn't really perform to lead dead spirits into the next world. It
            was only to give ghosts who still had lingering attachments to this
            world a little bit of fun. I thought it would be a good idea to let
            forget their all-too-short life with some exciting songs. But to say
            one more thing, it was my sisters who told me to do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your sisters must really enjoy live performances to be planning them
            so often.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>Well, it was because I lost to my sister before.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>So winning and losing has nothing to do with your mood.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>I was only kidding!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I think of it, during your solo performance, I wasn't
            expecting you to perform with instruments besides the trumpet. Why
            did you play other instruments?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If I only play the trumpet, I'm limited to playing the melody. Being
            able to play as many instruments as I want to as the same time sure
            is handy. I played the trombone, which spun less than the trumpet,
            the tuba, which spun more than the trumpet, and the horn, which spun
            much more than the trumpet. And there were many others too.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Your instruments set the standard for spinning, huh?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span></p>
          <p>
            When I think about getting others excited, I try to play just enough
            to do that. That's why I play spinning instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I think that when you perform, you yourself spin just as much.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Merlin</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's exciting, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Yes, exciting enough for me.</p>
