		<img style="width: 300px; height: 300px; float: left;" alt="" src="068BAiJRMeiling.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">On 
		the &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;th of &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;, a strange pattern suddenly appeared in the gardens of 
		the Scarlet Devil Manor.</p>
		<p>The pattern was in the shape of a five-pointed star, and people began 
		to whisper about crop circles at the Scarlet Devil Manor.</p>
		<p>However, the pattern wasn&#39;t formed by flowers being pressed to the ground, 
		but rather, the flowers in the pattern had all turned white, as if a group 
		of white flowers had sprung up among the crimson ones.</p>
		<p>People are saying this state of affairs at the Scarlet Devil Manor is 
		an example of the much-rumored crop circle.</p>
		<p>Crop circles are a deeply mysterious phenomenon where geometric patterns 
		appear in fields.</p>
		<p>However, nobody had ever seen one before, so it had remained a mysterious 
		rumor.</p>
		<p>The mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Remilia Scarlet (vampire), 
		had this to say about the phenomenon:</p>
		<p>&quot;Crop circles are a good omen, aren&#39;t they? A white star in a flower 
		field ... It&#39;s surely a symbol of victory, no?</p>
		<p>It&#39;s unclear whose victory it&#39;s meant to represent, but it certainly 
		is nice to look at the brilliant pattern in the flowers.</p>
		<p>Crop circles certainly do seem to be good omens of sorts.</p>
		<p>The individual in charge of the garden in question is the Scarlet Devil 
		Manor&#39;s door guard, Hong Meiling (youkai).</p>
		<p>I asked her about this incident as well.</p>
		<p>&quot;Is it really a crop circle? It doesn&#39;t really look like one to me ... 
		I was so scared because I thought she&#39;d get mad again. I&#39;m in charge of 
		maintaining the garden, after all. Even if she told me to change it back, 
		I don&#39;t have the slightest idea how to do that, or how it happened, so I&#39;m 
		so glad the mistress likes it.&quot;</p>
		<p>Even now, the Scarlet Devil Manor&#39;s garden has a white star where the 
		flowers have changed colors.</p>
		<p>The star-shaped crop circle makes the brilliant crimson flower garden 
		even more amazing to look at.</p>
		<p>Nobody knows who did this or why, but people still talk of it being the 
		work of aliens.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, the mistress got tired of it, so she told me to change it back.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So the star pattern is still there?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t even know how to make flowers change colors, so I can&#39;t really 
		make it change back just because she says so.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Why don&#39;t you try telling her that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That won&#39;t do me any good~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Why don&#39;t you try tricking her somehow until they wilt?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There&#39;s no way I could do that~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, she&#39;ll get angry if you don&#39;t do anything, right? You should just 
		tell her it&#39;s impossible.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How could I tell her that? She knew I couldn&#39;t do anything about it from 
		the start. But the mistress likes teasing people, so ... *sob sob*</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>In any case, I wonder what that star pattern is.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, that is the question, isn&#39;t it? But nobody will touch it. Everyone 
		just says how beautiful or interesting it is. I&#39;m the only one worried about 
		it, since I&#39;m in charge of maintaining the gardens.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Everyone calls it a crop circle ...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But it&#39;s not even circle shaped. It&#39;s kind of suspicious how it just 
		appeared suddenly out of nowhere. It happened in the time it took me to 
		make my rounds around the perimeter of the mansion. It was only about thirty 
		minutes.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Was it really that short?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Probably.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>You didn&#39;t fall asleep on the way, did you?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I-I wouldn&#39;t slack off like that!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hm, that&#39;s not normal. Still, it&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s the work of aliens, 
		like some people say.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh? If you&#39;re not as smart as aliens, I bet you&#39;d think they couldn&#39;t 
		do it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But what could this garden mean to the aliens? It&#39;s just a star.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Mean? Anyway, I wonder what crop circles are. I&#39;ve never even heard of 
		them before, so I don&#39;t know much about them-</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>They say that crop circles are used in the outside world to breathe new 
		life into an old village. Supposedly somebody thought of it as a way to 
		bring tourists to old towns in the middle of nowhere with nothing but farming 
		fields.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, Miss Patchouli, it&#39;s so unusual to see you out here.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You still haven&#39;t turned it back to normal? Remi will get mad, you know. 
		In any case, nobody really knows what crop circles are. They say they might 
		also be formed by something rising up to the surface from underground.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You seem to know a lot about crop circles.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>However, this star-shaped crop circle is an experiment of mine. I devised 
		it from the rumors.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meiling</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Huuuuuh!? What did you say!? </p>
