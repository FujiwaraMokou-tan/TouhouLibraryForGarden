              />The insect spirit Wriggle Nightbug (youkai) has begun sending
              out huge amounts of insects for the "Insects' News Service."
            </p>
            <p>This is hoping to improve the low social status of insects.</p>
            <p>What comes to mind on the subject of bugs?</p>
            <p>
              Maybe most people don't think of anything beyond food rations or
              garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days, they have no more than that degree of recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
              The leader of the bugs who are bothered by the present condition,
              in order to distrupt the status quo, has proposed the idea for
              this service.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea behind this service is that, if given plans and a time in
              advance, a huge number of insects would come and make
              announcements.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if someone asked for a morning call, a huge amount of
              insects would gather together on their futon and gently wake them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bugs aren't just winged types; insects with many legs could
              also be used, allowing for plentiful variations.
            </p>
            <p>I asked Ms. Wriggle to speak about this service.</p>
            <p>
              "I want people to realize that bugs are helpful, too. These days,
              everyone just makes fun of us, and it's getting annoying. They
              think even fireflies and pine crickets are just for display. When
              did humans start thinking they are such superior beings? However,
              if we harm humans, they might exterminate us... Therefore, if we
              can put an end to the idea that we aren't necessary in their
              lives, I think our social status would improve."
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Wriggle is managing this new service with her ability to
              manipulate insects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users are saying things like "I broke out in a cold sweat and woke
              up right away" and "With that rustling sound next to your ears,
              you can hardly contain yourself", so it seems to have a favorable
              reputation so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Ms. Wriggle added "We got tired of it, so we will
              probably stop soon." afterward.
            </p>
            <p>
              The life of insects is short, so it makes sense that the life of
              the Insects' News Service would also be short.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>I wonder how small the brains of insects are?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>

              It's not like that, we omit information as soon as it's no longer
              in use. Otherwise, we can't provide the Insect News Service.
              Because we can't remember the schedules of our customers.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>What, you remember that after all.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>I can't remember.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              I feel that in the past the power of insects was stronger. They
              would act as parasites on human beings, and they had stronger
              poisons... There were quite a few that could defeat even yokai
              with a single sting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>So the ones now are weak?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              They are. In the past many poisonous bugs would battle, and the
              last one standing would earn the knowledge of magical power. That
              was a dreadful thing. If you compare it to then, we only discover
              insects now to be of your level. So, you're all show aren't you?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>It makes me sad that you'd say it like that...... ooh...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>But this crow loves insects.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>Heh, we have another natural enemy here~</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>That's why humans call them beneficial birds.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't assume things like that! I feel that recently, to make
              matters worse, the number of bugs is decreasing year after year.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Isn't that good? Well, if the number of bugs decreases, the birds
              have something to worry about.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether there's not enough of us or we're being eaten we're
              worried... but more than that the problem is insecticide!
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>Insecticide? Ah, that handy tool created by humans?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to that my sweet bugs have turned to nothing.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>They're weak.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              You said that bugs used to survive things like poison, right?
              These attacks aren't at that level.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>When did I say that? Isn't this a chance?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>What chance?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              If you keep collecting the bugs that survive the insecticide, only
              the bugs who aren't affected by the insecticide will remain. You
              make new generations increasing their number for a while in this
              way.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>Oh-ho...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;But in the meantime, the humans can make a stronger and
              savage insecticide.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>......</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              And then you collect only the unaffected bugs, and increase their
              number again, and if the pattern continues...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span>
            </p>
            <p>Won't it only help making an invincible insecticide?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              But the humans have to make sure the insecticide won't hurt them
              as well, so there's a limit to how strong they can make it. Once
              that limit is reached, bugs will no longer be defeated by humans.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wriggle</span></p>
            <p>
              I see. It sounds like it would take quite long, so I should work
              harder...
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>But please feed the birds too, OK?</p>
