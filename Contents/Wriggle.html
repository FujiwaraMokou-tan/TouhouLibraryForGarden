              insect spirit Wriggle Nightbug (youkai) has begun sending
              out huge amounts of insects for the "Insects' News
              Service."</p>
            <p>This is hoping to improve the low social status of
              insects.</p>
            <p>What comes to mind on the subject of bugs?</p>
            <p>Maybe most people don't think of anything beyond food
              rations or garbage.</p>
            <p>These days, they have no more than that degree of
              recognition.</p>
            <p>The leader of the bugs who are bothered by the present
              condition, in order to distrupt the status quo, has
              proposed the idea for this service.</p>
            <p>The idea behind this service is that, if given plans and
              a time in advance, a huge number of insects would come and
              make announcements.</p>
            <p>For example, if someone asked for a morning call, a huge
              amount of insects would gather together on their futon and
              gently wake them.</p>
            <p>The bugs aren't just winged types; insects with many legs
              could also be used, allowing for plentiful variations.</p>
            <p>I asked Ms. Wriggle to speak about this service.</p>
            <p>"I want people to realize that bugs are helpful, too.
              These days, everyone just makes fun of us, and it's
              getting annoying. They think even fireflies and pine
              crickets are just for display. When did humans start
              thinking they are such superior beings? However, if we
              harm humans, they might exterminate us... Therefore, if we
              can put an end to the idea that we aren't necessary in
              their lives, I think our social status would improve."</p>
            <p>Ms. Wriggle is managing this new service with her ability
              to manipulate insects.</p>
            <p>Users are saying things like "I broke out in a cold sweat
              and woke up right away" and "With that rustling sound next
              to your ears, you can hardly contain yourself", so it
              seems to have a favorable reputation so far.</p>
            <p>However, Ms. Wriggle added "We got tired of it, so we
              will probably stop soon." afterward.</p>
            <p>The life of insects is short, so it makes sense that the
              life of the Insects' News Service would also be short.</p>

            <p>What? We're doing something like this?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>You mean your article? It was only the other day I was
              collecting data for it, wasn't it?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I don't remember.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I wonder how small the brains of insects are?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>It's not like that, we omit information as soon as it's
              no longer in use. Otherwise, we can't provide the Insect
              News Service. Because we can't remember the schedules of
              our customers.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>What, you remember that after all.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I can't remember.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I feel that in the past the power of insects was
              stronger. They would act as parasites on human beings, and
              they had stronger poisons... There were quite a few that
              could defeat even yokai with a single sting.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>So the ones now are weak?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>They are. In the past many poisonous bugs would battle,
              and the last one standing would earn the knowledge of
              magical power. That was a dreadful thing. If you compare
              it to then, we only discover insects now to be of your
              level. So, you're all show aren't you?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>It makes me sad that you'd say it like that...... ooh...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>But this crow loves insects.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Heh, we have another natural enemy here~</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>That's why humans call them beneficial birds.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Don't assume things like that! I feel that recently, to
              make matters worse, the number of bugs is decreasing year
              after year.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Isn't that good? Well, if the number of bugs decreases,
              the birds have something to worry about.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Whether there's not enough of us or we're being eaten
              we're worried... but more than that the problem&nbsp;is
              insecticide!</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



            </p>
            <p>Insecticide? Ah, that handy tool created by humans?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Thanks to that my sweet bugs have turned to nothing.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>They're weak.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>You said that bugs used to survive things like poison,
              right? These attacks aren't at that level.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



            </p>
            <p>When did I say that? Isn't this a chance?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>What chance?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>If you keep collecting the bugs that survive the
              insecticide, only the bugs who aren't affected by the
              insecticide will remain. You make new generations
              increasing their number for a while in this way.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Oh-ho...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;But in the meantime, the humans can make a stronger
              and savage insecticide.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>......</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>And then you collect only the unaffected bugs, and
              increase their number again, and if the pattern
              continues...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Won't it only help making an invincible insecticide?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>But the humans have to make sure the insecticide won't
              hurt them as well, so there's a limit to how strong they
              can make it. Once that limit is reached, bugs will no
              longer be defeated by humans.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wriggle</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I see. It sounds like it would take quite long, so I
              should work harder...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>But please feed the birds too, OK? </p>
