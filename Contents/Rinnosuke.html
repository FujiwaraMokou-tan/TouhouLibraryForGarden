                alt="" src="074BAiJRRinnosuke.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">The
              arrival of a large, mysterious pot at Kourindou, the
              antique store by the forest's entrance, was begging to
              become a topic. Its height is that of a person's hip, so
              it is very big indeed. According to the Kourindou's owner,
              it's called a nargile.</p>
            <p>According to the store owner, the nargile is a type of
              tobacco-water smoker, one which you can use to enjoy the
              tobacco slowly over a very long period. If it is for
              smoking tobacco, however &#8211; with its huge pot and
              mouthpiece-looking pipes, and even a plate on the pot's
              top opening &#8211; it is quite different from the tobacco
              smoking tools we all know. Besides, even the owner said he
              had not even the slightest idea of how to use it.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Being a tobacco inhaler, I would think you use it to
              ignite tobacco and inhale the smoke, but for this one to
              involve water into it... it seems incompatible. If it is a
              tobacco-water inhaler, you would think you use water in
              it, but how it makes the water give off smoke is something
              I don't know.&#8221;</p>
            <p>So said Kourindou's owner, Rinnosuke Morichika
              (Half-human, half-youkai). The store's owner went on
              explaining:</p>
            <p>"This nargile would make a splendid decoration, it looks
              like a pot but is not a pot, looks like a light but is not
              a lighthouse; its incongruous form is magnificent. You are
              likely to never have the chance to obtain such a thing
              again. You will definitely regret it if you don't buy it
              now. It's a one-time-only article.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Kourindou is a place where usable-looking items fallen
              from the outside are gathered and sold. So, besides not
              knowing when the next arrivals will come, the same items
              might not show up again. Interested people that don't mind
              not knowing how to use it, and are fine having it for
              decoration, should then go buy it right away. The price is
              open to bargain.</p>
            <p>As for me, I've never seen smoking tools other than a
              pipe, and I wouldn't really want such a big one that is
              impossible to carry around. But since I believe this one
              is for smoking calmly while sitting down, people that
              would want to pass the afternoon tea time leisurely having
              an elegant smoke might as well consider purchasing it.</p>

            <p>It's been quite a while since that article. Did you sell
              it after all?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The nargile? It's not for sale anymore, I took it out.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>Is that so? Well, for something that big... without
              knowing how to use it, it would never sell.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>There were a lot of people who showed interest. It's just
              that I changed my mind about selling it.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Was there a defect in the article, then?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I figured out how to use it. That's why I put it out of
              sale.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Excuse me?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>It would've been a waste, wouldn't it? I might never have
              the chance to obtain another one.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Ahh, so you are keeping it for your own use? ...But can
              your business carry on like that?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Business or not, a terrible waste is a terrible waste.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I don't quite understand your reasons for opening a shop.
              Besides, being that close to the forest, I don't think
              humans actually come. Are you really intent on doing
              business?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>That's a rather complex question. It will take me some
              time to answer it... wait a moment.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Complex, was it...?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>This is the nargile.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Yes, I know that.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The preparations take some time, but once lit, the
              tobacco lasts for more than one hour. You put the burning
              charcoal here, and then the tobacco here. And about your
              earlier question, of course I'm fully intent on doing
              business.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I see, so that's how it's smoked. And how did you figure
              out how to use it?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>It came in a flash, while I was in the middle of some
              trial and error. It was when a youkai that knows a lot
              about the outside world taught it to me.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>So, someone taught you? You didn't have to say it like
              you had figured it out by yourself, then.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Not only does smoking with this take longer than usual
              but, once you start, you can't carry it around with you.
              That's why it's ideal for smoking while reading a book or
              having a tea.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>That's why you said you didn't want to sell it anymore...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>And I won't; it's not for sale.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>And I don't want to buy it. Isn't a tobacco smoker this
              big a little inconvenient? And the water, what is it for?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The water... is to weigh it down so it doesn't collapse,
              I guess.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Quite a nonsensical smoker, right?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Aren't all luxury goods nonsensical to begin with? But if
              it weren't for people who can't appreciate them, there
              wouldn't be any interesting people. People that appreciate
              luxury goods like liquor, teas, coffee, tobacco, and the
              like are always seen as very interesting people.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Speaking of which, people who live away from the human
              village are all into luxury goods. People who like luxury
              items are all strange ones indeed.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rinnosuke</span>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>And they are mostly self-centered folk, if I might add. </p>
