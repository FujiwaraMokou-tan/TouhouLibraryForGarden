              />The arrival of a large, mysterious pot at Kourindou, the antique
              store by the forest's entrance, was begging to become a topic. Its
              height is that of a person's hip, so it is very big indeed.
              According to the Kourindou's owner, it's called a nargile.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the store owner, the nargile is a type of
              tobacco-water smoker, one which you can use to enjoy the tobacco
              slowly over a very long period. If it is for smoking tobacco,
              however &#8211; with its huge pot and mouthpiece-looking pipes,
              and even a plate on the pot's top opening &#8211; it is quite
              different from the tobacco smoking tools we all know. Besides,
              even the owner said he had not even the slightest idea of how to
              use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              &#8220;Being a tobacco inhaler, I would think you use it to ignite
              tobacco and inhale the smoke, but for this one to involve water
              into it... it seems incompatible. If it is a tobacco-water
              inhaler, you would think you use water in it, but how it makes the
              water give off smoke is something I don't know.&#8221;
            </p>
            <p>
              So said Kourindou's owner, Rinnosuke Morichika (Half-human,
              half-youkai). The store's owner went on explaining:
            </p>
            <p>
              "This nargile would make a splendid decoration, it looks like a
              pot but is not a pot, looks like a light but is not a lighthouse;
              its incongruous form is magnificent. You are likely to never have
              the chance to obtain such a thing again. You will definitely
              regret it if you don't buy it now. It's a one-time-only
              article.&#8221;
            </p>
            <p>
              Kourindou is a place where usable-looking items fallen from the
              outside are gathered and sold. So, besides not knowing when the
              next arrivals will come, the same items might not show up again.
              Interested people that don't mind not knowing how to use it, and
              are fine having it for decoration, should then go buy it right
              away. The price is open to bargain.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for me, I've never seen smoking tools other than a pipe, and I
              wouldn't really want such a big one that is impossible to carry
              around. But since I believe this one is for smoking calmly while
              sitting down, people that would want to pass the afternoon tea
              time leisurely having an elegant smoke might as well consider
              purchasing it.

              It's been quite a while since that article. Did you sell it after
              all?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>The nargile? It's not for sale anymore, I took it out.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Is that so? Well, for something that big... without knowing how to
              use it, it would never sell.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              There were a lot of people who showed interest. It's just that I
              changed my mind about selling it.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Was there a defect in the article, then?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>I figured out how to use it. That's why I put it out of sale.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Excuse me?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              It would've been a waste, wouldn't it? I might never have the
              chance to obtain another one.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Ahh, so you are keeping it for your own use? ...But can your
              business carry on like that?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>Business or not, a terrible waste is a terrible waste.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              I don't quite understand your reasons for opening a shop. Besides,
              being that close to the forest, I don't think humans actually
              come. Are you really intent on doing business?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              That's a rather complex question. It will take me some time to
              answer it... wait a moment.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Complex, was it...?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>This is the nargile.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Yes, I know that.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The preparations take some time, but once lit, the tobacco lasts
              for more than one hour. You put the burning charcoal here, and
              then the tobacco here. And about your earlier question, of course
              I'm fully intent on doing business.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              I see, so that's how it's smoked. And how did you figure out how
              to use it?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              It came in a flash, while I was in the middle of some trial and
              error. It was when a youkai that knows a lot about the outside
              world taught it to me.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              So, someone taught you? You didn't have to say it like you had
              figured it out by yourself, then.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only does smoking with this take longer than usual but, once
              you start, you can't carry it around with you. That's why it's
              ideal for smoking while reading a book or having a tea.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>That's why you said you didn't want to sell it anymore...</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>And I won't; it's not for sale.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              And I don't want to buy it. Isn't a tobacco smoker this big a
              little inconvenient? And the water, what is it for?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The water... is to weigh it down so it doesn't collapse, I guess.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Quite a nonsensical smoker, right?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rinnosuke</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Aren't all luxury goods nonsensical to begin with? But if it
              weren't for people who can't appreciate them, there wouldn't be
              any interesting people. People that appreciate luxury goods like
              liquor, teas, coffee, tobacco, and the like are always seen as
              very interesting people.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Speaking of which, people who live away from the human village are
              all into luxury goods. People who like luxury items are all
              strange ones indeed.
