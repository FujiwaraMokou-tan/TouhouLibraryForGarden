            />At the X month, X day, around 19 hours, flames rose from the
            Bamboo Forest in the vicinities of Eientei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, it only spread to a 10 meter circumference before being
            checked off and extinguished.
          </p>
          <p>There were no victims from this fire.</p>
          <p>
            The firefight was carried out by the joint efforts of two girls and
            several rabbits that were at the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without further knowledge about the fire's cause, and considering
            the possibility of arson, I'm conducting an investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fujiwara no Mokou and Kaguya Houraisan (both human), who carried out
            the extinguishing, spoke about the circumstances of the fire's cause
            and the firefight.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fire's cause? Well... yeah, well, I don't know about that, but I
            was there by coincidence so I helped to put it out. Thankfully, it
            didn't become a tragedy. (Mokou)
          </p>
          <p>
            My house is nearby here. If the fire were to spread there, it would
            be a problem. In these circumstances, wouldn't anyone put out a fire
            that starts up in front of one's own eyes? (Kaguya)
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is to say that they were together at the fire's scene by
            coincidence, and don't know about its cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            With nothing in the vicinity that would cause the fire naturally, I
            can only think of it being either arson or spontaneous combustion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost nobody lives around here besides the Eientei residents, and
            people seldom pass through this place. Had the sighting been any
            later, it would have become a great tragedy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Co-could it have been some tobacco litterings? Youngsters these days
            ain't got no common sense. They recklessly do the most unbelievable
            things. (Mokou)
          </p>
          <p>
            It could have been a discarded yakitori. Since this place is a Mecca
            for yakitori. (Kaguya)
          </p>
          <p>
            Being myself a crow tengu, at hearing the words Mecca for yakitori,
            I found myself wanting to quickly take my leave from this place.
            Therefore, I refrained from a more detailed investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, when thinking it over calmly, I realized that, besides the
            fact that a yakitori couldn't possibly have caused a bushfire, the
            birds that were said to be in the area of the fire scene were
            actually rabbits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps this all points to the rabbits being the ones who started
            the fire? Let's consider it that way.
          </p>
          <p>I don't know when and where this fire started.</p>
          <p>
            More importantly, I recommend to always check twice for flammable
            objects around you.

            What a weird article. From the point in which it starts about
            yakitori, it really doesn't look like something fit for a newspaper,
            right?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>I'm doing a reflection on this.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Your discipline is lacking, isn't it? And what is it today? Wasn't
            this incident already settled?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            I just had some thoughts about it... Speaking of which, the other
            person..?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Kaguya? Hmmm, I thought that she would say that she's too busy and
            doesn't want to come, so I didn't call her.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>This is assuming too much on your own.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>But I'm free.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Well, either of you is fine. So, the main question is: Regarding
            this fire, what was its true cause?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>Tobacco litterings.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            There weren't any other people besides you two, right? And yet the
            fire was quickly put out.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>What are you trying to say?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>
            If you think calmly about that, anyone would reach the conclusion
            that you were the ones who started the fire. Given the
            circumstances, it's the only thing one can conclude.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>What started the fire were some tobacco litterings.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>Could have been something in there that you needed to hide?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Hu hu. If you go around inquiring too much, something awful might
            just happen. Because this place is a... how was it, a Mecca for
            yakitori, right?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Yakitori! Th-that's it, I remembered. The reason that this place is
            called a Mecca for yakitori...
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>Is today's lucky food foie gras?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>; .</p>
          <p>..it's because a bird of fire is often seen around here...</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>But don't you have to avoid eating too much liver?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>And about this bird of fire and yakitori, Miss Kaguya was...</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>Hard liver tastes so bad...</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>...should I spell it all out?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>Oops. Wonder if we'll have an emergency around here today?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>An emergency, like one happening all of a sudden!?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>Aren't they always something sudden? What's wrong with that?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>
            I messed up. I mean... that's not it! Could you listen seriously to
            what people are saying from the beginning?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Back at that time, there wasn't any fire. There's not a single trace
            of fire in the bamboo forest, you haven't seen anything. That was a
            peaceful, uneventful day. And that's about it.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>
            I won't accept such distortion of the truth. And foremost, the news
            edition has already come out.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Wrong reports simply happen in newspapers. If you do your best to
            cancel that edition and keep the mistakes under wraps, this incident
            will simply wane away, right?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>I will never do such a thing.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            Truly such an inflexible tengu... Since your head is so hard, should
            we put it to roast a little? Or maybe you are hard all the way to
            the liver?
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>;</p>
          <p>Just what kind of human are you, threatening me like that?</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mokou</span>;</p>
          <p>
            One that has at the least lived more than you. Your great senior.
            So, wanna try it? Making crow yakitori with the firebird's flame?
