		the X month, X day, around 19 hours, flames rose from the Bamboo Forest 
		in the vicinities of Eientei.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, it only spread to a 10 meter circumference before being 
		checked off and extinguished.</p>
		<p>There were no victims from this fire.</p>
		<p>The firefight was carried out by the joint efforts of two girls and several 
		rabbits that were at the scene.</p>
		<p>Without further knowledge about the fire&#39;s cause, and considering the 
		possibility of arson, I&#39;m conducting an investigation.</p>
		<p>Fujiwara no Mokou and Kaguya Houraisan (both human), who carried out 
		the extinguishing, spoke about the circumstances of the fire&#39;s cause and 
		the firefight.</p>
		<p>&quot;The fire&#39;s cause? Well... yeah, well, I don&#39;t know about that, but I 
		was there by coincidence so I helped to put it out. Thankfully, it didn&#39;t 
		become a tragedy.&quot; (Mokou)</p>
		<p>&quot;My house is nearby here. If the fire were to spread there, it would 
		be a problem. In these circumstances, wouldn&#39;t anyone put out a fire that 
		starts up in front of one&#39;s own eyes?&quot; (Kaguya)</p>
		<p>Which is to say that they were together at the fire&#39;s scene by coincidence, 
		and don&#39;t know about its cause.</p>
		<p>With nothing in the vicinity that would cause the fire naturally, I can 
		only think of it being either arson or spontaneous combustion.</p>
		<p>Almost nobody lives around here besides the Eientei residents, and people 
		seldom pass through this place. Had the sighting been any later, it would 
		have become a great tragedy.</p>
		<p>&quot;Co-could it have been some tobacco litterings? Youngsters these days 
		ain&#39;t got no common sense. They recklessly do the most unbelievable things.&quot; 
		(Mokou)</p>
		<p>&quot;It could have been a discarded yakitori. Since this place is a Mecca 
		for yakitori.&quot; (Kaguya)</p>
		<p>Being myself a crow tengu, at hearing the words &quot;Mecca for yakitori&quot;, 
		I found myself wanting to quickly take my leave from this place. Therefore, 
		I refrained from a more detailed investigation.</p>
		<p>Later, when thinking it over calmly, I realized that, besides the fact 
		that a yakitori couldn&#39;t possibly have caused a bushfire, the birds that 
		were said to be in the area of the fire scene were actually rabbits.</p>
		<p>Perhaps this all points to the rabbits being the ones who started the 
		fire? Let&#39;s consider it that way.</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t know when and where this fire started.</p>
		<p>More importantly, I recommend to always check twice for flammable objects 
		around you.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What a weird article. From the point in which it starts about yakitori, 
		it really doesn&#39;t look like something fit for a newspaper, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m doing a reflection on this.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Your discipline is lacking, isn&#39;t it? And what is it today? Wasn&#39;t this 
		incident already settled?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I just had some thoughts about it... Speaking of which, the other person..?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Kaguya? Hmmm, I thought that she would say that she&#39;s too busy and doesn&#39;t 
		want to come, so I didn&#39;t call her.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This is assuming too much on your own.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But I&#39;m free.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, either of you is fine. So, the main question is: Regarding this 
		fire, what was its true cause?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Tobacco litterings.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>There weren&#39;t any other people besides you two, right? And yet the fire 
		was quickly put out.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What are you trying to say?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you think calmly about that, anyone would reach the conclusion that 
		you were the ones who started the fire. Given the circumstances, it&#39;s the 
		only thing one can conclude.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What started the fire were some tobacco litterings.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Could have been something in there that you needed to hide?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hu hu. If you go around inquiring too much, something awful might just 
		happen. Because this place is a... how was it, a Mecca for yakitori, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yakitori! Th-that&#39;s it, I remembered. The reason that this place is called 
		a Mecca for yakitori...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is today&#39;s lucky food foie gras?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
		<p>..it&#39;s because a bird of fire is often seen around here...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But don&#39;t you have to avoid eating too much liver?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>And about this bird of fire and yakitori, Miss Kaguya was...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hard liver tastes so bad...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...should I spell it all out?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oops. Wonder if we&#39;ll have an emergency around here today?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>An emergency, like one happening all of a sudden!?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Aren&#39;t they always something sudden? What&#39;s wrong with that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I messed up. I mean... that&#39;s not it! Could you listen seriously to what 
		people are saying from the beginning?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Back at that time, there wasn&#39;t any fire. There&#39;s not a single trace 
		of fire in the bamboo forest, you haven&#39;t seen anything. That was a peaceful, 
		uneventful day. And that&#39;s about it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I won&#39;t accept such distortion of the truth. And foremost, the news edition 
		has already come out.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Wrong reports simply happen in newspapers. If you do your best to cancel 
		that edition and keep the mistakes under wraps, this incident will simply 
		wane away, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I will never do such a thing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Truly such an inflexible tengu... Since your head is so hard, should 
		we put it to roast a little? Or maybe you are hard all the way to the liver?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Just what kind of human are you, threatening me like that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mokou</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>One that has at the least lived more than you. Your great senior. So, 
		wanna try it? Making crow yakitori with the firebird&#39;s flame? </p>
