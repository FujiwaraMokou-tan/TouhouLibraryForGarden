            <p>
              It's said that deep in the mountains, far from the human village,
              is a small field where only cats live.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cats live there independently, in a self-sustained society
              controlled only by cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until now, it's been an unverified rumor, so I decided to go find
              the field and see for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The field wasn't quite as the rumors described, but indeed, a
              group of cats were living in a ghost town abandoned by humans,
              which had essentially become a cat village.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, it was hardly a well-regulated society - each cat did
              whatever it wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a chaotic place where the cats constantly fought among
              themselves and hardly seemed to notice when a stranger such as
              myself appeared, and they would all crowd around at the sight of a
              scrap of food.
            </p>
            <p>
              The individual in charge of trying to create some order in this
              chaos was Chen (Shikigami).
            </p>
            <p>I asked her why she had brought all the cats here, and how.</p>
            <p>"No, no, don't go over there.</p>
            <p>Hm?</p>
            <p>Why did I bring the cats here?</p>
            <p>Ehehe, I wanted servants who would listen to my commands.</p>
            <p>
              I figured I'd pick out the ones who were strongest and listened to
              my orders best and make them my servants.
            </p>
            <p>Getting them here was easy.</p>
            <p>
              When I put out food and just a little bit of catnip, they all came
              willingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              They can find shelter from the weather in the old, abandoned
              houses, and I'll catch food for them, so it's like a cat
              paradise."
            </p>
            <p>As she was speaking, the cats were roaming freely to and fro.</p>
            <p>
              It seemed to be because their catnip was too strong, but according
              to Chen, if they couldn't run around like this they wouldn't obey
              her orders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certainly, a great number of youkai use animals as their servants.
              Frankly speaking, even I keep a crow.
            </p>
            <p>However, I've never heard of a ghost cat keeping other cats.</p>
            <p>
              That is probably because cats are very independent and willful
              creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps this is because it would take a stronger youkai than a
              ghost cat to successfully keep other cats as servants.

            </p>
            <p>
              It looks like you've gotten scratched up quite a bit since then.
              Are you okay?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen </span></p>
            <p>
              It's because they just won't listen to me. As soon as I tell them
              something they don't want to do, this happens. Why won't they
              listen to me?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              You should understand that fairly well, shouldn't you? After all,
              you're a ghost cat.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>What do you mean? Maybe I don't have enough catnip ...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>What you're really missing is authority. In great quantities.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Maybe I don't have enough bait ...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>
              Maybe you need to think more than you need bait? You're a cat
              yourself, so the best you can hope for in a servant is probably a
              mouse.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Having a mouse servant wouldn't be cool at all.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              If you want to freely control cats, I think relying on catnip is a
              mistake. If some youkai gave you catnip, would you listen to their
              orders?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>No way!</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>
              You're a familiar too, right? Perhaps you should think about why
              you listen to your master.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>
              Hmmm. It's because Ran-sama is so strong, and ... wait, you mean I
              have to get stronger, or they won't listen?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Perhaps you should consider finding easier to control servants.
              Like, say, a mouse.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Or maybe something else, like a bird.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>No, don't use birds.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Maybe I could try a sparrow ...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Oh, but even if you do that, you can't just abandon all the cats
              here. Something terrible would happen to them.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>I'm not giving up on cats. I've already tamed this this well-</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              That's not saying that much ... It doesn't look like they're that
              fond of you.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>
              Of course they are! They come running to see me when I put out
              food, and even if I'm not putting out food. That's where most of
              my scratches come from.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>Maybe they just see you as food now, too. They'll eat you.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Well, my fingers are pretty chewed up.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>You can't really win over animals by raising them like that.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>
              Hm, say, how did you tame that crow? It looks like it really likes
              you.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              When you're as strong as I am, all you have to do is hold out your
              hand to it when you first meet it. You can't really expect to have
              servants without that sort of absolute difference in power.
              Besides, this crow is more like my tool than my servant.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>But even I'm way stronger than these normal cats.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>I don't think you'd be so scratched up if that were the case.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>I think that's because I don't have enough catnip ...</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Look, your master is much, much stronger than you, right?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>Yeah.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Your master doesn't have to use catnip on you to control you,
              right?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Chen</span></p>
            <p>She does it sometimes.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              ... in any case, you have to have that sort of difference in power
              to order someone around.
