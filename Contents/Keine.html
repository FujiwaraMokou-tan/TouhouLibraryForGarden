		the Human Village, there are rumors of the existence of a secret society.</p>
		<p>The society&#39;s purported aims are to find the tracks of the human and 
		youkai that reside in Gensokyo, and discover the secrets of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>Since they also investigate the youkai&#39;s areas of activity, it was said 
		that deaths also occurred in extreme cases during the investigations.</p>
		<p>This time we have contacted the person who claims to be the leader of 
		said secret society.</p>
		<p>Mr. A (pseudonym) of the secret society explains the origins of the society 
		as thus:</p>
		<p>People nowadays know nothing about things like why do youkai live here, 
		what is Gensokyo, what kind of people were their ancestors, and so on.</p>
		<p>When the omniscient youkai are chased from Gensokyo and Gensokyo falls 
		under human control, it is absolutely necessary that they know the truths 
		about Gensokyo, said he.</p>
		<p>Despite this extremely self-centered and human-like behavior, many youkai, 
		including myself, are remaining as spectators rather than taking the group 
		as an enemy.</p>
		<p>Some youkai are also offering their frank advice on the matter.</p>
		<p>I listened to the thoughts of one such youkai, Miss Keine Kamishirasawa 
		(were-hakutaku).</p>
		<p>&quot;It&#39;s not good that some humans have forgotten their fear of youkai and 
		are trying to drive them out of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>Gensokyo is keeping a balance now between youkai and humans.</p>
		<p>Just like (the half-human, half-beast) me.</p>
		<p>If that give-and-take balance is destroyed, Gensokyo will collapse in 
		an instant.</p>
		<p>Even if many people now think of youkai as they once were, these memories 
		can fade in 20 years when the next generation comes about.</p>
		<p>The youkai are not fighting back.</p>
		<p>The humans have arbitrarily decided to get away from the youkai.</p>
		<p>Humans should not be searching for history now, instead they should be 
		passing history down as if they&#39;re happening now, that&#39;s the more important 
		thing.&quot;</p>
		<p>Ms. Keine is half-youkai but is endeared by the humans. She sometimes 
		helps in their daily lives.</p>
		<p>If dangerous ideas are formed from this society because the humans have 
		not passed on their history to their descendants, she said she has considered 
		opening a history school.</p>

		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: right;" alt="" src="055BAiJRKeine.jpg" align="right" hspace="20"></p>
		<p>So has the history school opened in the village?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes it has. But it didn&#39;t manage to attract many people. Everyone dislikes 
		schools, it seems.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s surprising. If we knew something that interesting is starting, 
		we&#39;ll be the first to go see it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Humans barely get by in their everyday lives. They can&#39;t think like you 
		easy-going youkai. If they don&#39;t work for their food, they starve to death.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Why don&#39;t you trying opening a school not just for humans but one that 
		is mixed with youkai? That way it&#39;s bound to attract everyone.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That would, wouldn&#39;t it. But I don&#39;t think I can teach normally if I 
		attracted them like that....I don&#39;t actually want to attract, I want to 
		teach humans. Attracting and teaching youkai defeat that purpose, don&#39;t 
		they?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yeah, that&#39;s true. Another suggestion then, why don&#39;t you bring sake 
		along? Humans love sake too.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That wouldn&#39;t work as a class. In the end, the humans who want to know 
		history only want to make a world for their own. Maybe normal human beings 
		don&#39;t have any interest in history. That&#39;s too bad.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>There&#39;s one group near the shrine that is beginning to change. There&#39;s 
		a feeling of &quot;Me First&quot;.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I can&#39;t do anything about those humans. Already there isn&#39;t much of a 
		difference between them and youkai.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If it&#39;s just by ability, a normal youkai is no match for them.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That reminds me, there have been these strangers at the shrine. You can&#39;t 
		get near to the shrine due to the youkai there, the humans in the village 
		don&#39;t find it necessary to travel any distances from the shrine...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Is that so....? In that case, humans wouldn&#39;t usually visit and pray 
		at the shrine?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s no wonder that the miko is always complaining about not receiving 
		donations at all. She brought it upon herself. If she was serious about 
		it she would have gone to the village and advertise her work. Even if that 
		miko works, the humans usually don&#39;t get to hear about it. I heard that 
		she also befriended youkai. There are even people who said the shrine was 
		overtaken by youkai.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It seems that the miko&#39;s stance is leading to some misunderstanding among 
		the humans. That miko does seem uncooperative towards humans; you&#39;re more 
		inclined towards humans than she is.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keine</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Since I&#39;ve taken the place of the miko, Gensokyo&#39;s balance is maintained. 
		Do you actually record such human matters, being a youkai yourself?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>All of my newspaper&#39;s content and readership come from youkai. Well, 
		it&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t anything about monster-like humans, but basically 
		this article was meant to be about you. If you weren&#39;t there, I couldn&#39;t 
		have made the article. For us, humans are just targets for attacking, you 
		know? </p>
