            />In the Human Village, there are rumors of the existence of a
            secret society.
          </p>
          <p>
            The society's purported aims are to find the tracks of the human
            and youkai that reside in Gensokyo, and discover the secrets of
            Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since they also investigate the youkai's areas of activity, it
            was said that deaths also occurred in extreme cases during the
            investigations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time we have contacted the person who claims to be the leader
            of said secret society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. A (pseudonym) of the secret society explains the origins of the
            society as thus:
          </p>
          <p>
            People nowadays know nothing about things like why do youkai live
            here, what is Gensokyo, what kind of people were their ancestors,
            and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the omniscient youkai are chased from Gensokyo and Gensokyo
            falls under human control, it is absolutely necessary that they know
            the truths about Gensokyo, said he.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this extremely self-centered and human-like behavior, many
            youkai, including myself, are remaining as spectators rather than
            taking the group as an enemy.
          </p>
          <p>Some youkai are also offering their frank advice on the matter.</p>
          <p>
            I listened to the thoughts of one such youkai, Miss Keine
            Kamishirasawa (were-hakutaku).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not good that some humans have forgotten their fear
            of youkai and are trying to drive them out of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>Gensokyo is keeping a balance now between youkai and humans.</p>
          <p>Just like (the half-human, half-beast) me.</p>
          <p>
            If that give-and-take balance is destroyed, Gensokyo will collapse
            in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if many people now think of youkai as they once were, these
            memories can fade in 20 years when the next generation comes about.
          </p>
          <p>The youkai are not fighting back.</p>
          <p>
            The humans have arbitrarily decided to get away from the youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans should not be searching for history now, instead they should
            be passing history down as if they're happening now, that's
            the more important thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ms. Keine is half-youkai but is endeared by the humans. She
            sometimes helps in their daily lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            If dangerous ideas are formed from this society because the humans
            have not passed on their history to their descendants, she said she
            has considered opening a history school.

          </p>
          <p>So has the history school opened in the village?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes it has. But it didn't manage to attract many people.
            Everyone dislikes schools, it seems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's surprising. If we knew something that interesting is
            starting, we'll be the first to go see it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans barely get by in their everyday lives. They can't think
            like you easy-going youkai. If they don't work for their food,
            they starve to death.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Why don't you trying opening a school not just for humans but
            one that is mixed with youkai? That way it's bound to attract
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That would, wouldn't it. But I don't think I can teach
            normally if I attracted them like that....I don't actually want
            to attract, I want to teach humans. Attracting and teaching youkai
            defeat that purpose, don't they?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, that's true. Another suggestion then, why don't you
            bring sake along? Humans love sake too.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That wouldn't work as a class. In the end, the humans who want
            to know history only want to make a world for their own. Maybe
            normal human beings don't have any interest in history.
            That's too bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            There's one group near the shrine that is beginning to change.
            There's a feeling of Me First.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't do anything about those humans. Already there isn't
            much of a difference between them and youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If it's just by ability, a normal youkai is no match for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That reminds me, there have been these strangers at the shrine. You
            can't get near to the shrine due to the youkai there, the humans
            in the village don't find it necessary to travel any distances
            from the shrine...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Is that so....? In that case, humans wouldn't usually visit and
            pray at the shrine?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's no wonder that the miko is always complaining about not
            receiving donations at all. She brought it upon herself. If she was
            serious about it she would have gone to the village and advertise
            her work. Even if that miko works, the humans usually don't get
            to hear about it. I heard that she also befriended youkai. There are
            even people who said the shrine was overtaken by youkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems that the miko's stance is leading to some
            misunderstanding among the humans. That miko does seem uncooperative
            towards humans; you're more inclined towards humans than she is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Keine</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I've taken the place of the miko, Gensokyo's balance
            is maintained. Do you actually record such human matters, being a
            youkai yourself?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            All of my newspaper's content and readership come from youkai.
            Well, it's not like there isn't anything about monster-like
            humans, but basically this article was meant to be about you. If you
            weren't there, I couldn't have made the article. For us,
            humans are just targets for attacking, you know?
