            />On the &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;th of &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;, I became
            aware that the Moon had suddenly and silently exploded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this was a major event, it occurred so late at night that
            most people never realized it happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon quietly scattered out across the sky, and its countless
            glimmering fragments descended to the Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before long, the fragments thinned out like mist, and then gathered
            together again to reform the full moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this happened silently over a very short period of time in the
            middle of the night, it was a stroke of the greatest fortune to bear
            witness to this fantastically unreal spectacle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting out to find out what had happened, I was able to gather
            enough information to allow me to make contact with the individual
            who caused the Moon to explode.
          </p>
          <p>That individual was Suika Ibuki (oni).</p>
          <p>
            She appeared to be extraordinarily drunk, but she spoke quite
            lucidly when I asked her about this incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon? Ah, that was a threat, a simple threat. Everyone looked
            like they were having so much fun, saying 'onis out, onis out' over
            and over, so I thought I'd just come back with a little threat. It
            looks like you were really surprised, though.
          </p>
          <p>I was indeed surprised, as I'm sure anyone would be.</p>
          <p>I then asked her how she'd made the Moon explode.</p>
          <p>
            Just what do you think the moon up in the sky is? Everyone sees that
            big, round shiny thing and thinks there must be something round up
            there, right? That's just silly. The truth is much more awesome than
            that. You can almost never see the real Moon, and its appearance is
            death to humans. You can only see the Moon when it's reflected in
            things. And the things it reflects in, like water or glass, can all
            be broken, right? Since the moon you see in the sky is just being
            reflected in the heavens, if you tear open the heavens it's easy to
            break it~
          </p>
          <p>
            I understood how she'd broken the Moon, but it was unclear how she'd
            managed to shatter the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>Still, the power of the oni defies imagination.</p>
          <p>
            They can probably shatter the heavens with their eyes closed and one
            hand tied behind their back.
          </p>

          <p>
            The whole time? Look, I've been drinking non-stop for hundreds of
            years. The last time I was sober is a tale from the far past~
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            I suppose it's too late to say that drinking that much might be bad
            for your health...

          <p>
            Please, I'm not foolish enough to get into a drinking match with an
            oni.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Aw, come on~ You're a tengu, right? Tengu are pretty big drinkers,
            too~
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ohoho. I'm on the job at the moment. Still, I found a nice food cart
            recently; would you like to go for a drink afterwards?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>Food cart? Maybe it's a yakitori cart~</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Grilled eel, I'm afraid. Their vegetable and meat skewers are the
            best as drink chasers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sounds nice. Parties are great, but maybe it's best to sit and drink
            quietly once in a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This cart isn't the quietest place, I'm afraid...the owner sings a
            lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>If she's so noisy I can't drink, I'll just make her shut up.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hm, hearing that from an oni...makes me feel sorry for the poor
            bird. Still, I was very surprised. That matter of the Moon is one
            thing, but I didn't think there were any oni left in Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh, well, I came back for a while. I'm the only one, though~</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Gensokyo might become even more lively with an oni around.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>I was sad to see the tengu had lost their hold on the world~</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please, you're exaggerating. The tengu would never do such a thing.
            Besides, such power is usually the purview of the oni.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I see you tengu are all talk, same as ever. You've always been
            humble to anyone stronger than you, and assertive towards the weak.
            You're actually really strong, but you go easy on everyone, and you
            play dumb even though you're really smart. You're all so sly. What
            opportunists.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please, you don't have to go that far. We tengu really aren't as
            strong as we used to be. We're merely simple rumormongers, nowadays.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hm, I wonder how serious you are? Well, I see you all still love
            gossip as much as you did in the old days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            And I see the oni are still amazing. It's very unusual to be able to
            shatter the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ehehe, that's just a little trick. I'm good at diffusing and
            gathering things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh, does that mean you'd also be good at gathering news?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Huh? N-news? O-of course, I could do that with my little finger.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, that's amazing~. Why don't we go off to that cart and continue
            this conversation over a drink? I'm sure you have a lot of
            interesting things to tell me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Suika</span>
          </p>
          <p>Sure. Tonight, we'll drink until we can't talk anymore!</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya&nbsp; </span></p>
          <p>
            Ohoho, but I'm a tengu, you know? If I get so smashed I can't hear
            you talk anymore...hahahahaha
          </p>
