		<img style="width: 300px; height: 300px; float: left;" alt="" src="072BAiJRSuika.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">On 
		the &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;th of &#9675;&#9675;&#9675;, I became aware that the Moon had suddenly and silently 
		exploded.</p>
		<p>Although this was a major event, it occurred so late at night that most 
		people never realized it happened.</p>
		<p>The Moon quietly scattered out across the sky, and its countless glimmering 
		fragments descended to the Earth.</p>
		<p>Before long, the fragments thinned out like mist, and then gathered together 
		again to reform the full moon.</p>
		<p>Since this happened silently over a very short period of time in the 
		middle of the night, it was a stroke of the greatest fortune to bear witness 
		to this fantastically unreal spectacle.</p>
		<p>Setting out to find out what had happened, I was able to gather enough 
		information to allow me to make contact with the individual who caused the 
		Moon to explode.</p>
		<p>That individual was Suika Ibuki (oni).</p>
		<p>She appeared to be extraordinarily drunk, but she spoke quite lucidly 
		when I asked her about this incident.</p>
		<p>&quot;The Moon? Ah, that was a threat, a simple threat. Everyone looked like 
		they were having so much fun, saying &#39;onis out, onis out&#39; over and over, 
		so I thought I&#39;d just come back with a little threat. It looks like you 
		were really surprised, though.&quot;</p>
		<p>I was indeed surprised, as I&#39;m sure anyone would be.</p>
		<p>I then asked her how she&#39;d made the Moon explode.</p>
		<p>&quot;Just what do you think the moon up in the sky is? Everyone sees that 
		big, round shiny thing and thinks there must be something round up there, 
		right? That&#39;s just silly. The truth is much more awesome than that. You 
		can almost never see the real Moon, and its appearance is death to humans. 
		You can only see the Moon when it&#39;s reflected in things. And the things 
		it reflects in, like water or glass, can all be broken, right? Since the 
		moon you see in the sky is just being reflected in the heavens, if you tear 
		open the heavens it&#39;s easy to break it~&quot;</p>
		<p>I understood how she&#39;d broken the Moon, but it was unclear how she&#39;d 
		managed to shatter the heavens.</p>
		<p>Still, the power of the oni defies imagination.</p>
		<p>They can probably shatter the heavens with their eyes closed and one 
		hand tied behind their back.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Sake please~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;ve just been drinking the whole time.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The whole time? Look, I&#39;ve been drinking non-stop for hundreds of years. 
		The last time I was sober is a tale from the far past~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I suppose it&#39;s too late to say that drinking that much might be bad for 
		your health...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Wanna have a drinking match?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Please, I&#39;m not foolish enough to get into a drinking match with an oni.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Aw, come on~ You&#39;re a tengu, right? Tengu are pretty big drinkers, too~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ohoho. I&#39;m on the job at the moment. Still, I found a nice food cart 
		recently; would you like to go for a drink afterwards?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Food cart? Maybe it&#39;s a yakitori cart~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Grilled eel, I&#39;m afraid. Their vegetable and meat skewers are the best 
		as drink chasers.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Sounds nice. Parties are great, but maybe it&#39;s best to sit and drink 
		quietly once in a while.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This cart isn&#39;t the quietest place, I&#39;m afraid...the owner sings a lot.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If she&#39;s so noisy I can&#39;t drink, I&#39;ll just make her shut up.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hm, hearing that from an oni...makes me feel sorry for the poor bird. 
		Still, I was very surprised. That matter of the Moon is one thing, but I 
		didn&#39;t think there were any oni left in Gensokyo.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, well, I came back for a while. I&#39;m the only one, though~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Gensokyo might become even more lively with an oni around.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I was sad to see the tengu had lost their hold on the world~</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Please, you&#39;re exaggerating. The tengu would never do such a thing. Besides, 
		such power is usually the purview of the oni.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see you tengu are all talk, same as ever. You&#39;ve always been humble 
		to anyone stronger than you, and assertive towards the weak. You&#39;re actually 
		really strong, but you go easy on everyone, and you play dumb even though 
		you&#39;re really smart. You&#39;re all so sly. What opportunists.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Please, you don&#39;t have to go that far. We tengu really aren&#39;t as strong 
		as we used to be. We&#39;re merely simple rumormongers, nowadays.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hm, I wonder how serious you are? Well, I see you all still love gossip 
		as much as you did in the old days.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And I see the oni are still amazing. It&#39;s very unusual to be able to 
		shatter the heavens.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ehehe, that&#39;s just a little trick. I&#39;m good at diffusing and gathering 
		things.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, does that mean you&#39;d also be good at gathering news?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Huh? N-news? O-of course, I could do that with my little finger.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, that&#39;s amazing~. Why don&#39;t we go off to that cart and continue this 
		conversation over a drink? I&#39;m sure you have a lot of interesting things 
		to tell me.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Sure. Tonight, we&#39;ll drink until we can&#39;t talk anymore!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Ohoho, but I&#39;m a tengu, you know? If I get so smashed I can&#39;t hear you 
		talk anymore...hahahahaha</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suika</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>This is why they say, &quot;Never get too close to tengu.&quot; </p>
