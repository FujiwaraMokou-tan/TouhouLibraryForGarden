            />O Month O Day, at around 26 o'clock, I suddenly heard a cry
            similar to that of a fox's.
          </p>
          <p>
            It did not seem like a trifling matter, so I rubbed my sleepy eyes
            and headed for the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrived, I saw in front of me a fox being dominated, a truly
            shocking view of animal abuse.
          </p>
          <p>As I am a crow tengu, this case is extremely heart-wrenching.</p>
          <p>The offender of this animal abuse is Yukari Yakumo (Youkai).</p>
          <p>
            She's a one-of-a-kind type of youkai whose residence is unknown; she
            unexpectly appears and disappears, and her being itself is a
            mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            She always wears flashy clothes and an eerie smile, so everytime I
            meet her I'm a little overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>The offender had this to say regarding her animal abuse:</p>
          <p>
            Animal abuse? My, when did I ever do such a thing? Aah, you mean
            this Ran here. This isn't abuse, just a little disciplining.
            Besides, Ran may look like a fox but she's a shikigami. She's not an
            animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the offender's words are completely illogical nonsense which
            any normal person would not easily comprehend, I've taken the
            liberty of interpreting it such a way that will make things clearer.
          </p>
          <p>The offender's phrases can be explained as followed.</p>
          <p>
            Ran, the fox that was being abused, is not an animal at all but a
            shikigami.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shikigami are not animals, but rather merely tools, and the more one
            uses tools the more love there is.
          </p>
          <p>That is why she uses her frequently.</p>
          <p>
            She says that just loving is not enough, that this is another form
            of love as she smacks the fox's head with her parasol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listen. Shikigami need only to do as they are ordered. Today, you
            went ahead and fought with humans, didn't you? I do not recall
            ordering that. No matter what happens before your eyes, even before
            any danger that may approach you, you are only to do as I say.
            That's what's best for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The offender continues with her irrational claims, and was
            attempting to justify her abuse.
          </p>
          <p>As I am half animal, I intend to further pursue this.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not abusing any beast. Besides, you're the one that wrote this,
            no? Then you should fully understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not understand what you are saying. What I witnessed was
            nothing other than animal abuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewing things from only one point of view shows that you lack
            imagination and analysis skills. Even if the answer is in front of
            your eyes then, you'll be blind to it. That's because you can only
            see the back side of the answer. In reality, you're doing pretty
            well as a reporter.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
          <p>
            Even if I do not understand what you are saying, if I look at the
            truth I will. That is because my job is to tell only the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you can see, with holes for eyes you won't be able to look
            at any truth. Your newspaper is going to stay shoddy that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Bunbunmaru Newspaper is not anything near shoddy!</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            At any rate, I'll explain once again for the sake of Ran's honour.
            That isn't abuse, it's discipline. Ran is a shikigami, so if she
            doesn't do exactly as I say she can't make use of her full strength.
            Even so, she ignored orders and went off and fought with humans. So
            I scolded her.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>...Wouldn't she be in danger if she didn't fight?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not at all. The only danger is from fighting. Do you understand? Ran
            is not a fox, but a shikigami.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That is what I do not understand. Exactly how are they different?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            By following my will, shikigami can achieve power equal to my level.
            Therefore, if she properly follows my orders, it would be impossible
            for her to lose. If she takes selfish actions, her power will be
            weakened to something that can't even be compared to mine. Fighting
            in that state is nothing other than foolish.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>What if she was sure she could win like that?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            With a more definite method of victory on hand, what need is there
            to choose a hazardous one? That would only end up with Ran in
            danger. That's why unless I teach her with slightly stricter means,
            it won't help Ran at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>......</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            And besides, Ran occasionally forgets that she's a shikigami. But
            that is an extremely dangerous thing. If she does not grasp her true
            nature, her power will easily veer of course. I did leave her alone
            while I was sleeping so that can't be helped. But at the very least,
            it seems like she definitely won't forget who is her master.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Essentially, isn't she just afraid of the abuse?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>Difference in power. Also, virtue.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>I will not be fooled by your selfish convenient explanations.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>You really can't grasp things.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am only burning in righteous anger. Whatever reason you may have,
            I cannot overlook abuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Yukari</span>
          </p>
          <p>My, my, you're quite the cute one.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Wh, what are you---</p>

            If you can't understand, want to give it a shot? Become my
            shikigami. If you do, I think you'll be able to understand.
