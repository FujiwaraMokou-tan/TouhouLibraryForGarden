		Month O Day, at around 26 o&#39;clock, I suddenly heard a cry similar to that 
		of a fox&#39;s.</p>
		<p>It did not seem like a trifling matter, so I rubbed my sleepy eyes and 
		headed for the scene.</p>
		<p>When I arrived, I saw in front of me a fox being dominated, a truly shocking 
		view of animal abuse.</p>
		<p>As I am a crow tengu, this case is extremely heart-wrenching.</p>
		<p>The offender of this animal abuse is Yukari Yakumo (Youkai).</p>
		<p>She&#39;s a one-of-a-kind type of youkai whose residence is unknown; she 
		unexpectly appears and disappears, and her being itself is a mystery.</p>
		<p>She always wears flashy clothes and an eerie smile, so everytime I meet 
		her I&#39;m a little overwhelmed.</p>
		<p>The offender had this to say regarding her animal abuse:</p>
		<p>&quot;Animal abuse? My, when did I ever do such a thing? Aah, you mean this 
		Ran here. This isn&#39;t abuse, just a little disciplining. Besides, Ran may 
		look like a fox but she&#39;s a shikigami. She&#39;s not an animal.&quot;</p>
		<p>Since the offender&#39;s words are completely illogical nonsense which any 
		normal person would not easily comprehend, I&#39;ve taken the liberty of interpreting 
		it such a way that will make things clearer.</p>
		<p>The offender&#39;s phrases can be explained as followed.</p>
		<p>Ran, the fox that was being abused, is not an animal at all but a shikigami.</p>
		<p>Shikigami are not animals, but rather merely tools, and the more one 
		uses tools the more love there is.</p>
		<p>That is why she uses her frequently.</p>
		<p>She says that just loving is not enough, that this is another form of 
		love as she smacks the fox&#39;s head with her parasol.</p>
		<p>&quot;Listen. Shikigami need only to do as they are ordered. Today, you went 
		ahead and fought with humans, didn&#39;t you? I do not recall ordering that. 
		No matter what happens before your eyes, even before any danger that may 
		approach you, you are only to do as I say. That&#39;s what&#39;s best for you.&quot;</p>
		<p>The offender continues with her irrational claims, and was attempting 
		to justify her abuse.</p>
		<p>As I am half animal, I intend to further pursue this.</p>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see. And?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I will not forgive animal abuse.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m not abusing any beast. Besides, you&#39;re the one that wrote this, no? 
		Then you should fully understand.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I do not understand what you are saying. What I witnessed was nothing 
		other than animal abuse.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Viewing things from only one point of view shows that you lack imagination 
		and analysis skills. Even if the answer is in front of your eyes then, you&#39;ll 
		be blind to it. That&#39;s because you can only see the back side of the answer. 
		In reality, you&#39;re doing pretty well as a reporter.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Even if I do not understand what you are saying, if I look at the truth 
		I will. That is because my job is to tell only the truth.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Even if you can see, with holes for eyes you won&#39;t be able to look at 
		any truth. Your newspaper is going to stay shoddy that way.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>&quot;Bunbunmaru Newspaper&quot; is not anything near shoddy!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>At any rate, I&#39;ll explain once again for the sake of Ran&#39;s honour. That 
		isn&#39;t abuse, it&#39;s discipline. Ran is a shikigami, so if she doesn&#39;t do exactly 
		as I say she can&#39;t make use of her full strength. Even so, she ignored orders 
		and went off and fought with humans. So I scolded her.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...Wouldn&#39;t she be in danger if she didn&#39;t fight?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Not at all. The only danger is from fighting. Do you understand? Ran 
		is not a fox, but a shikigami.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That is what I do not understand. Exactly how are they different?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>By following my will, shikigami can achieve power equal to my level. 
		Therefore, if she properly follows my orders, it would be impossible for 
		her to lose. If she takes selfish actions, her power will be weakened to 
		something that can&#39;t even be compared to mine. Fighting in that state is 
		nothing other than foolish.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>What if she was sure she could win like that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>With a more definite method of victory on hand, what need is there to 
		choose a hazardous one? That would only end up with Ran in danger. That&#39;s 
		why unless I teach her with slightly stricter means, it won&#39;t help Ran at 
		all.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>......</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>And besides, Ran occasionally forgets that she&#39;s a shikigami. But that 
		is an extremely dangerous thing. If she does not grasp her true nature, 
		her power will easily veer of course. I did leave her alone while I was 
		sleeping so that can&#39;t be helped. But at the very least, it seems like she 
		definitely won&#39;t forget who is her master.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Essentially, isn&#39;t she just afraid of the abuse?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Difference in power. Also, virtue.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>I will not be fooled by your selfish convenient explanations.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You really can&#39;t grasp things.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I am only burning in righteous anger. Whatever reason you may have, I 
		cannot overlook abuse.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>My, my, you&#39;re quite the cute one.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Wh, what are you---</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yukari</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If you can&#39;t understand, want to give it a shot? Become my shikigami. 
		If you do, I think you&#39;ll be able to understand.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
