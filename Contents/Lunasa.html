		<img style="width: 300px; height: 301px; float: left;" alt="" src="BAiJRLunasa1.JPG" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">I 
		learned that on Xth the X, the poltergeists who were performing at Hakugyokurou 
		suddenly announced a change of venues in the middle of their performance, 
		moving the entire audience in front of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
		<p>Although there were no major disturbances as the concert continued after 
		the move, even the audience members were tilting their heads about this 
		migration from the Netherworld to the world of the living, wondering, &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
		<p>In the end, no explanation was given after the concert was over, and 
		the audience was too excited to bother bringing up the question.</p>
		<p>The ones behind such a clamorous concert were the Prismriver Sisters 
		(Poltergeists).</p>
		<p>The eldest sister and the leader of the ensemble, Lunasa Prismriver, 
		had this to say about the move.</p>
		<p>&quot;The air pressure had decreased.</p>
		<p>At that time in Hakugyokurou, the air pressure was decreasing....</p>
		<p>If that continued, it was definitely going to rain.</p>
		<p>So I ordered my sisters to move.&quot;</p>
		<p>She also said that she didn&#39;t even tell her sisters, Merlin Prismriver 
		and Lyrica Prismriver, the reason why they were moving.</p>
		<p>&quot;The rain would fall if I told them or not.</p>
		<p>And the audience still followed us without complaints even without knowing 
		the reason.</p>
		<p>The audience loves the surprise of not knowing what&#39;s going to happen.</p>
		<p>If they knew the reason, then the move wouldn&#39;t be a surprise, it&#39;d be 
		an evacuation. They would surely object.&quot;</p>
		<p>Just as she thought, nobody in the audience said anything. If anything, 
		they seemed to enjoy this unexpected occurrence.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s often said that an artist is solely insistent about the performance, 
		and do not concern themselves with putting on a good show, they will never 
		become first-class.</p>
		<p>A concert should be made to entertain the audience.</p>
		<p>It is not enough to say that &quot;Good songs will make people happy.&quot;</p>
		<p>It is more like: &quot;A good concert makes your own songs sound even better.&quot;</p>
		<p>However, I couldn&#39;t find out why she was the only one who sensed that 
		it was going to rain soon.</p>
		<p>Judging by the fact that only the eldest sister sensed it, I don&#39;t think 
		that it is a unique trait of poltergeists.</p>

		<p>That was a fine performance at the concert. I enjoyed it as much as the 
		other ones.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It was no trouble at all. Even though we have instruments, we don&#39;t sing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see. The concert was fun. And it didn&#39;t rain today either.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What does rain have to do with the concert?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Here, in this article about the concert, you were the only one who seemed 
		to know it was going to rain in this article.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Yes, I knew that right away.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How did know that?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>When the air pressure decreased, the tension did as well.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I had no idea your intuition was so sharp...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Intuition? There seems to be some misunderstanding. I meant the tension 
		in my violin&#39;s bowstring. If it slackens, then the pitch decreases. The 
		reverberations change, too. That&#39;s how I figured it out so soon.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ah, so that&#39;s it. I certainly thought you seemed less tense.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The instrument was detuning so my tension was also decreasing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Ah, I see. But one question has been on my mind for a while. I said your 
		group was a band, but I don&#39;t really know if I can call it that. How do 
		you do it with only three people playing violin, trumpet, and keyboard?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How long has that been bothering you? You&#39;ve obviously seen us perform.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m not finished yet. Doesn&#39;t this seem like a strange combination of 
		instruments?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>How?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;m saying that I could never imagine what kind of songs that makeup 
		of instruments could perform, that it&#39;s difficult to think of a way to make 
		them work with each other. A normal band doesn&#39;t even have a violin to begin 
		with, right?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So what do you mean?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Nothing else needs to be said.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You don&#39;t know the first thing about music. The essence of music is about 
		producing sounds. It&#39;s never about copying them. The sheet music is superfluous. 
		Making the sounds itself is the most important point. If sounds removed 
		from nature are noise, there is no difference between excellent music and 
		noise.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s noise, huh? I certainly agree your group is noisy.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Something that can make sound, whatever they may be, can produce noise. 
		The performers make the music, the instruments are simply decorations.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So, you&#39;re saying that you play the violin as a result of just playing 
		whichever instrument you like?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>No, it&#39;s just because the violin is my forte.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But didn&#39;t you just say that instruments are simply decorations?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If it weren&#39;t my forte, I wouldn&#39;t be able to play the sounds I wanted, 
		would I? If I can&#39;t play it freely, I can&#39;t make noise.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I heard this can be a little hard to say, but to make a long story short, 
		your concerts are cacophonous.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunasa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I am very grateful for your compliment. </p>
