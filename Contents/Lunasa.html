            <img
              class="imageSizesOnTextLeftSide"

              hspace="2%"
            />I learned that on Xth the X, the poltergeists who were performing
            at Hakugyokurou suddenly announced a change of venues in the middle
            of their performance, moving the entire audience in front of the
            Scarlet Devil Mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there were no major disturbances as the concert continued
            after the move, even the audience members were tilting their heads
            about this migration from the Netherworld to the world of the
            living, wondering, Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, no explanation was given after the concert was over, and
            the audience was too excited to bother bringing up the question.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ones behind such a clamorous concert were the Prismriver Sisters
            (Poltergeists).
          </p>
          <p>
            The eldest sister and the leader of the ensemble, Lunasa Prismriver,
            had this to say about the move.
          </p>
          <p>The air pressure had decreased.</p>
          <p>
            At that time in Hakugyokurou, the air pressure was decreasing....
          </p>
          <p>If that continued, it was definitely going to rain.</p>
          <p>So I ordered my sisters to move.</p>
          <p>
            She also said that she didn't even tell her sisters, Merlin
            Prismriver and Lyrica Prismriver, the reason why they were moving.
          </p>
          <p>The rain would fall if I told them or not.</p>
          <p>
            And the audience still followed us without complaints even without
            knowing the reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            The audience loves the surprise of not knowing what's going to
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they knew the reason, then the move wouldn't be a surprise, it'd
            be an evacuation. They would surely object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as she thought, nobody in the audience said anything. If
            anything, they seemed to enjoy this unexpected occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's often said that an artist is solely insistent about the
            performance, and do not concern themselves with putting on a good
            show, they will never become first-class.
          </p>
          <p>A concert should be made to entertain the audience.</p>
          <p>It is not enough to say that Good songs will make people happy.</p>
          <p>
            It is more like: A good concert makes your own songs sound even
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I couldn't find out why she was the only one who sensed
            that it was going to rain soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judging by the fact that only the eldest sister sensed it, I don't
            think that it is a unique trait of poltergeists.

            That was a fine performance at the concert. I enjoyed it as much as
            the other ones.

            It was no trouble at all. Even though we have instruments, we don't
            sing.

          <p>I see. The concert was fun. And it didn't rain today either.</p>

          </p>
          <p>What does rain have to do with the concert?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, in this article about the concert, you were the only one who
            seemed to know it was going to rain in this article.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>Yes, I knew that right away.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>How did know that?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>When the air pressure decreased, the tension did as well.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I had no idea your intuition was so sharp...</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Intuition? There seems to be some misunderstanding. I meant the
            tension in my violin's bowstring. If it slackens, then the pitch
            decreases. The reverberations change, too. That's how I figured it
            out so soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Ah, so that's it. I certainly thought you seemed less tense.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>The instrument was detuning so my tension was also decreasing.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, I see. But one question has been on my mind for a while. I said
            your group was a band, but I don't really know if I can call it
            that. How do you do it with only three people playing violin,
            trumpet, and keyboard?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            How long has that been bothering you? You've obviously seen us
            perform.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not finished yet. Doesn't this seem like a strange combination
            of instruments?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>How?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm saying that I could never imagine what kind of songs that makeup
            of instruments could perform, that it's difficult to think of a way
            to make them work with each other. A normal band doesn't even have a
            violin to begin with, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>So what do you mean?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Nothing else needs to be said.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't know the first thing about music. The essence of music is
            about producing sounds. It's never about copying them. The sheet
            music is superfluous. Making the sounds itself is the most important
            point. If sounds removed from nature are noise, there is no
            difference between excellent music and noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's noise, huh? I certainly agree your group is noisy.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Something that can make sound, whatever they may be, can produce
            noise. The performers make the music, the instruments are simply
            decorations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, you're saying that you play the violin as a result of just
            playing whichever instrument you like?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>No, it's just because the violin is my forte.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But didn't you just say that instruments are simply decorations?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lunasa</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            If it weren't my forte, I wouldn't be able to play the sounds I
            wanted, would I? If I can't play it freely, I can't make noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I heard this can be a little hard to say, but to make a long story
            short, your concerts are cacophonous.
