            <p>Presently, I imagine everyone is already aware of the
              flowers blooming throughout Gensokyo.</p>
            <p>Instantly noticable, each and every flower blooming at
              the same time makes this feel like a mysterious season.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is unclear at the moment, but seeing
              all the flowers has lifted everyone's spirits so it
              doesn't feel dangerous at all.</p>
            <p>No one knows if this is someone up to mischief or merely
              a naturally-occuring phenomenon.</p>
            <p>However, in this ever-changing land, this phenomenon is
              seen as a gift from Gensokyo itself by youkai and humans
              and they are enjoying the spectacle.</p>
            <p>Like other incidents in recent years, this phenomenon has
              a strange nature as well.</p>
            <p>First, no one has any idea as to how this phenomenon came
              about.</p>
            <p>Every season's flowers are blooming regardess of
              temperature, time of day, time of sunrise, amount of
              rainfall, yet this is just another exempleary spring.</p>
            <p>At this point in time, no one knows who would make
              flowers from every season bloom at once.</p>
            <p>Also, one can make any flower bloom by giving it power,
              but there are too many of them for this to be realistic
              possibility.</p>
            <p>And there is one more unusual characteristic. If someone
              were to giving power to the flowers to make them bloom, no
              one can feel any danger anyway.</p>
            <p>That is, no one feels any strong power at work. The
              flowers only give off a faint energy.</p>
            <p>It is a power so thin that it feels as if it could vanish
              at any moment.</p>
            <p>There is no explanation for how such a thin power could
              cause something so widespread.</p>
            <p>This time, it's not just the youkai, but the humans who
              are also enjoying this phenomenon.</p>
            <p>The shrine maiden is also running around Gensokyo, but no
              one knows if she will really return everything back to
              normal.</p>
            <p>Meaning that while she usually headed for a single point
              before, this time, she's just staggering here and there.</p>
            <p>Perhaps she is also enjoying the flowery spectacle.</p>
            <p>But it's not just the shrine maiden. The humans and
              youkai alike are cheerfully flying around here and there.</p>
            <p>With everyone floating among the flowers, I'm sure that
              some noisy nonsense will happen whenever they unexpectedly
              run into each other.</p>
            <p>Is it is, everyone should be careful.</p>
            <p>I have also been enjoying this phenomemon, but while I
              was hiding among the flowers, I discovered another
              abnormal event.</p>
            <p>I think it's fair enough to call this an incident.</p>
            <p>What I saw is likely connected to the cause of the
              unusually blooming flowers, but I won't report anything
              until I can confirm it.</p>
            <p>I am presently in the middle of investigating this. Later
              on, I want to write a full report.</p>

              The power of colors that had endured the winter had been
              released. It was now the season of budding life, spring.</p>
            <p>The flowers were in full bloom, and the fairies were
              making a racket.</p>
            <p>--However, it wasn't just spring flowers, but flowers
              from every season had bloomed, but that was not the real
              incident.</p>
            <p>Reimu went about her usual routine, and flew out from the
              shrine with no goal in mind. </p>
