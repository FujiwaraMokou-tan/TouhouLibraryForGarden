              />X Month X Day, cherry blossoms are still in full bloom at the
              shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around this time last year, summer was about to take spring's
              place, however, the cherry blossoms show absolutely no sign of
              clearing up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe there is something behind this anomaly, but it is
              nothing more than another one of the many minor incidents that
              occur in Gensokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flower viewing takes place almost every night at the most
              magnificent shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
              To report this exciting event, I've made my way into the site of
              flower viewing and collected information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Humans, youkai, fairies, and a myriad of other species are
              enjoying themselves at the shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only one person who was in a bad mood was the shrine maiden of
              this shrine, Reimu Hakurei (human).
            </p>
            <p>
              I took a direct interview with her to discover why she was in such
              a foul mood.
            </p>
            <p>
              "What? Why am I in a bad mood even though there's a banquet going
              on? It's because of the banquet, of course, the banquet.
              Everyone's making all the mess they want, then end up tired and go
              home without even cleaning up. Or are you saying you'll help me
              clean up?"
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't want to help so I just poured her some of my sake and her
              mood took an instant turn for the better.
            </p>
            <p>It appears that she does not dislike drinking.</p>
            <p>
              The banquet is, as one would expect, bustling to the point of
              chaos.
            </p>
            <p>This time I decided asking a question from a different angle.</p>
            <p>
              The question was about the cherry blossoms that are still
              blooming.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked whether she knew the incident or not, and why she, if she
              had already realized, wasn't doing anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Incident? You mean the cherry blossoms that are still here? Ah,
              I've already taken care of it. In three days, the cherry blossoms
              are definitely going to start clearing just like last year. Not
              just the cherry blossoms, but the other off-season flowers as
              well... It's not that the flowers bloom because they want to.
              Losing their place... let's not talk about this, how about a
              drink? We're not going to be able to enjoy flower viewing soon
              anyway."
            </p>
            <p>
              Lately, there didn't seem to be any significant incidents, so it's
              a surprise that it's already been taken care of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reimu just seems to be a laid-back drunkard, but she's definitely
              the shrine maiden of Hakurei Shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tonight, I was able to get more information about how Reimu
              resolved this by getting her to drink more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to organize this information and report it in a few
              days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gensokyo's most beautiful cherry blossoms are at Hakurei Shrine.
              The full bloom seems as if it's going to end soon, so why not
              visit the shrine while you still can?

            <p>The heck. What's this weird dorky article?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Lately there haven't been any real incident-like incidents, so I
              didn't have a choice other than to write an article about this
              boring shrine.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>Don't call it boring. It's nice that it's peaceful.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>And spaced out.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              No it's not! And besides, if you have nothing to write about you
              can write about my heroic tale of how I resolved that
              irregularity.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Well, your heroic tale there seems really fishy. Not that I need
              full coverage, but I'd at least need some evidence before I can
              turn it into an article.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>It's not a lie. Your newspaper is far more full of lies.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Those aren't lies. It's the complete truth.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a saying that goes, "Repeat a lie a thousand times and it
              becomes truth."
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>What might you be saying?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not to mention, with the way you've written this article it seems
              like I'm just some drunkard.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              You're more than enough of one. If anyone gave you sake you'd
              start telling them anything. Even stuff you'd normally rather not
              be.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Uu. But you drank as much as I did, didn't you? How can you stay
              so level and write an article?
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              We tengu are great drinkers. Just the only ones that can match us
              would be... say, oni.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Aah, geez. I can't remember what I said at all. And nobody cleaned
              anything up in the end.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              You can't expect me to write an article of your heroic tale told
              while in that state.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>The heroic tale is true, though.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              What about the herioc tales before this one? The Eternal Night
              Incident and the Scarlet Mist Incident and such and such.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>All true.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              That's hard to believe. Really, unless I get some evidence, it's
              too risky for me to write an article about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu </span>
            </p>
            <p>Then why not get some? I'm pretty sure you know who to ask.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>Are you serious?</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              ...Yeah, I don't think a single one of them would give a decent
              testimony.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Besides, using a drunkard's nonsense as a spark is still
              difficult. It won't even become a lead for material.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>It's not nonsense, already.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              Even if you yourself don't remember what you said? You're kidding.
              Well, if I ever have a problem with article material, I might do
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>Geez, everytime it comes to this sly crow it's this.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>
              So, you're going to be doing flower viewing as well today, I
              assume.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Probably the last one of the year. I'd like some preparation and
              clean up help for at least the last one.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>Shall I assist you today? I'll pass on the bird stew, though.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>Eh? You're going to help?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span></p>
            <p>However, you have to win a match against me.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu</span>
            </p>
            <p>Piece of cake! So what are we competing in?</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
            <p>Drinking.</p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Reimu </span>
            </p>
            <p>Aaah, I wish someone would help.</p>
