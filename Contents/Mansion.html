          <p>In Gensokyo, there's a somewhat large and deep lake.</p>
          <p>
            Near the lake stands a western-style mansion painted in a
            conspicuous, dazzling scarlet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's called the Scarlet Devil Mansion, for the vampire who lives
            there.
          </p>
          <p>The interior is based on scarlet and other dazzling colors.</p>
          <p>
            Still, it has few windows and the inside is somewhat dark, so the
            color isn't too hard on the eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, the restless atmosphere from the whole mansion gives it a
            childish feel.
          </p>
          <p>Yes, the vampire who is the mistress is still a child.</p>
          <p>
            In this western-styled mansion, they always hold various events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, most of them aren't announced in advance, so the few other
            people attend them other than the residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are a lot of maids. Only the staff of the Scarlet
            Devil Mansion seem to be able to enjoy them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holding such events shows the character of the mistress, who's not
            elegant at all, like the color of the mansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know when it showed up, but I believe it hasn't existed for
            long.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surely the building isn't new. It may be the one that originally
            stood in the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a building loses its existence from the outer world, it can
            sometimes become an illusionary one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm afraid in the outside world, such antique mansions may not exist
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if they exist, they may be imaginary buildings; just for
            display, and not for living in.
          </p>
          <p>Inside the mansion lives the vampire and the maids serving her.</p>
          <p>
            The existence of the whole mansion in Gensokyo may show that the
            vampire and maid are the illusionary beings that do not exist in the
            outer world anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess it's possible to see that an event occurred in the outside
            world which would bring it here.
