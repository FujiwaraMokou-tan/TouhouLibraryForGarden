		<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
		<p>In Gensokyo, there&#39;s a somewhat large and deep lake.</p>
		<p>Near the lake stands a western-style mansion painted in a conspicuous, 
		dazzling scarlet.</p>
		<p>It&#39;s called the Scarlet Devil Mansion, for the vampire who lives there.</p>
		<p>The interior is based on scarlet and other dazzling colors.</p>
		<p>Still, it has few windows and the inside is somewhat dark, so the color 
		isn&#39;t too hard on the eyes.</p>
		<p>Even so, the restless atmosphere from the whole mansion gives it a childish 
		feel.</p>
		<p>Yes, the vampire who is the mistress is still a child.</p>
		<p>In this western-styled mansion, they always hold various events.</p>
		<p>Still, most of them aren&#39;t announced in advance, so the few other people 
		attend them other than the residents.</p>
		<p>However, there are a lot of maids. Only the staff of the Scarlet Devil 
		Mansion seem to be able to enjoy them.</p>
		<p>Holding such events shows the character of the mistress, who&#39;s not elegant 
		at all, like the color of the mansion.</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t know when it showed up, but I believe it hasn&#39;t existed for long.</p>
		<p>Surely the building isn&#39;t new. It may be the one that originally stood 
		in the outside world.</p>
		<p>If a building loses its existence from the outer world, it can sometimes 
		become an illusionary one.</p>
		<p>I&#39;m afraid in the outside world, such antique mansions may not exist 
		anymore.</p>
		<p>Even if they exist, they may be imaginary buildings; just for display, 
		and not for living in.</p>
		<p>Inside the mansion lives the vampire and the maids serving her.</p>
		<p>The existence of the whole mansion in Gensokyo may show that the vampire 
		and maid are the illusionary beings that do not exist in the outer world 
		anymore.</p>
		<p>I guess it&#39;s possible to see that an event occurred in the outside world 
		which would bring it here.</p>
