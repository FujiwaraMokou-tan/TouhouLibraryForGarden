            />It has already been half a month since Gensokyo was covered in a
            scarlet mist.
          </p>
          <p>
            This incident that hasn't even been completely resolved yet, seeing
            it, one could say it's a large event that only happens every couple
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think we should cut into this incident from a different
            perspective, for once.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may have heard, on one holiday, Gensokyo became covered in an
            unusually thick mist that some say even blocked out light. That is
            the situation up until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this mist had a slight scarlet tint, it generally became known
            as the scarlet mist incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this extremely thick mist, anyone close to it wouldn't be
            able to see anything. So, the tengu tribe revived their unique
            abilities and observed the incident from super-high altitude.
          </p>
          <p>I was able to obtain a photograph from this.</p>
          <p>
            From this, it was established that the scarlet mist was more
            irregular and the light and shade variation was more intense than
            expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parts with the deepest scarlet concentration completely blocked
            out light. It was impossible to see the ground there.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, for some reason, the light and shade variation of this mist
            formed a pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern traced several lines wrapping across Gensokyo so it
            looked almost like tengu wings.
          </p>
          <p>
            It looks like the lines originated from somewhere around the
            mountain lake, but it is hard to tell because the ground is covered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, aside from these wings, I noticed a bright light coming
            from the surface of the earth occasionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing this from the air, the light formed a scarlet rainbow when it
            was emitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was unable to tell what the light was, but around here people just
            call things a mysterious phenomenon if they can't observe them
            normally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strange pattern that would have never been seen from the ground
            and the circular rainbow, I don't know the intention of the person
            that created them, but there must be some clue left behind by the
            person responsible.
          </p>
          <p>The sunless summer continues.</p>
          <p>
            There are surely feelings of tedium towards this chilling mist
            surrounding Gensokyo, but youkai that fly in the air are encouraged
            to enjoy the spectacle above the mist.\

          <p>Why are you showing me this old newspaper?</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to know if there was any meaning behind it.</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern in the mist? The red rainbow? I don't know anything
            about that. And I'm surprised you know it was I who released the
            mist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be strange for me not to know. Immediately after the
            scarlet mist incident, Marisa started visiting your mansion
            regularly, and you started visiting the shrine regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's true that I was the one that released the mist, but I don't
            know of any pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            ...So you're saying there's no meaning behind it? Even though it was
            so clear?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Didn't I just say that? I don't know anything about what caused it
            either. It's probably from an unknown natural phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, what do you think about the light and rainbow in this
            photograph?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hmm, let me see. Isn't that just the light from when humans go wild?
            That's what it looks like from above.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Those humans always go wild when this sort of event occurs.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>It's extremely annoying.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Odd that you should be the one to say that. Anyway, let's get back
            to the subject of the mist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the form of the mist is something with high density and fine
            particles... It would probably bend light into a something like a
            rainbow. Just like real mist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>If that's so, why would the rainbow be scarlet?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            My mist is like jewels that are finer than fine water droplets.
            That's what gives it such a hazy hue of red.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Oh.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Patchouli</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Remi's mist is almost like jewels that are denser than regular water
            droplets, so it bends light stronger than water droplets. That's why
            Remi's mist is called &quot;bewitching mist&quot;. As the wavelength
            of the refracted light drops past scarlet, it becomes completely
            diffused and most of the light is absorbed by the mist. That's why
            only the straightest scarlet remains and the rainbow appears to be
            scarlet colored.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Remilia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's right. It's just like I said-- That's unusual. Is it tea time
            already?
          </p>
          <p>

            Sakuya said that we're having an unusual visitor, so I came to
            watch.

            Thank you for having me. I'm just here to collect some data as I
            thought it might make good material for an article.

            I see. Apparently, my mist looks like a pair of angel's wings when
            seen from the skies. Do you see anything, Patche?

            Oh, I get it now. I'm sure that was the shape of my hands when I
