		has already been half a month since Gensokyo was covered in a scarlet mist.</p>
		<p>This incident that hasn&#39;t even been completely resolved yet, seeing it, 
		one could say it&#39;s a large event that only happens every couple years.</p>
		<p>I think we should cut into this incident from a different perspective, 
		for once.</p>
		<p>As you may have heard, on one holiday, Gensokyo became covered in an 
		unusually thick mist that some say even blocked out light. That is the situation 
		up until now.</p>
		<p>Since this mist had a slight scarlet tint, it generally became known 
		as the scarlet mist incident.</p>
		<p>Because of this extremely thick mist, anyone close to it wouldn&#39;t be 
		able to see anything. So, the tengu tribe revived their unique abilities 
		and observed the incident from super-high altitude.</p>
		<p>I was able to obtain a photograph from this.</p>
		<p>From this, it was established that the scarlet mist was more irregular 
		and the light and shade variation was more intense than expected.</p>
		<p>The parts with the deepest scarlet concentration completely blocked out 
		light. It was impossible to see the ground there.</p>
		<p>However, for some reason, the light and shade variation of this mist 
		formed a pattern.</p>
		<p>The pattern traced several lines wrapping across Gensokyo so it looked 
		almost like tengu wings.</p>
		<p>It looks like the lines originated from somewhere around the mountain 
		lake, but it is hard to tell because the ground is covered.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, aside from these wings, I noticed a bright light coming 
		from the surface of the earth occasionally.</p>
		<p>Seeing this from the air, the light formed a scarlet rainbow when it 
		was emitted.</p>
		<p>I was unable to tell what the light was, but around here people just 
		call things a mysterious phenomenon if they can&#39;t observe them normally.</p>
		<p>The strange pattern that would have never been seen from the ground and 
		the circular rainbow, I don&#39;t know the intention of the person that created 
		them, but there must be some clue left behind by the person responsible.</p>
		<p>The sunless summer continues.</p>
		<p>There are surely feelings of tedium towards this chilling mist surrounding 
		Gensokyo, but youkai that fly in the air are encouraged to enjoy the spectacle 
		above the mist.\</p>

		<p>Why are you showing me this old newspaper?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I wanted to know if there was any meaning behind it.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>The pattern in the mist? The red rainbow? I don&#39;t know anything about 
		that. And I&#39;m surprised you know it was I who released the mist.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It would be strange for me not to know. Immediately after the scarlet 
		mist incident, Marisa started visiting your mansion regularly, and you started 
		visiting the shrine regularly.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s true that I was the one that released the mist, but I don&#39;t know 
		of any pattern.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...So you&#39;re saying there&#39;s no meaning behind it? Even though it was 
		so clear?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Didn&#39;t I just say that? I don&#39;t know anything about what caused it either. 
		It&#39;s probably from an unknown natural phenomenon.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, what do you think about the light and rainbow in this photograph?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Hmm, let me see. Isn&#39;t that just the light from when humans go wild? 
		That&#39;s what it looks like from above.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those humans always go wild when this sort of event occurs.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>It&#39;s extremely annoying.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Odd that you should be the one to say that. Anyway, let&#39;s get back to 
		the subject of the mist.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Since the form of the mist is something with high density and fine particles... 
		It would probably bend light into a something like a rainbow. Just like 
		real mist.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>If that&#39;s so, why would the rainbow be scarlet?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>My mist is like jewels that are finer than fine water droplets. That&#39;s 
		what gives it such a hazy hue of red.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Remi&#39;s mist is almost like jewels that are denser than regular water 
		droplets, so it bends light stronger than water droplets. That&#39;s why Remi&#39;s 
		mist is called &quot;bewitching mist&quot;. As the wavelength of the refracted light 
		drops past scarlet, it becomes completely diffused and most of the light 
		is absorbed by the mist. That&#39;s why only the straightest scarlet remains 
		and the rainbow appears to be scarlet colored.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s just like I said-- That&#39;s unusual. Is it tea time 
		already?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Sakuya said that we&#39;re having an unusual visitor, so I came to watch.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Thank you for having me. I&#39;m just here to collect some data as I thought 
		it might make good material for an article.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I see. Apparently, my mist looks like a pair of angel&#39;s wings when seen 
		from the skies. Do you see anything, Patche?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Let me see that newspaper...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Here you are.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>An angel, they say. Not that I particularly mind being called that.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What a strange devil you are.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I don&#39;t see anything wrong with this.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>What? Do you get it? I&#39;m impressed!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Remi&#39;s fingers.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remilia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Oh, I get it now. I&#39;m sure that was the shape of my hands when I released 
		the mist. Something like this?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patchouli</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Just like that.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>So you release the mist from your fingertips... </p>
