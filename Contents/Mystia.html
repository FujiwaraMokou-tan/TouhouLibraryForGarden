            />Recently, a night sparrow has started a promising new business.
          </p>
          <p>
            That business is not a grilled chicken stand, but rather, a grilled
            lamprey stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day a red-lantern stand suddenly appeared on a road that few
            people travel at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            When someone lured by the inviting red lights and passes through the
            shop's curtain, they'll find a grilled lamprey stand instead of a
            grilled chicken stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            This peculiar ingredient is becoming a topic within the curious
            circles of Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who runs this stand is Ms. Mystia Lorelei (Night Sparrow).
          </p>
          <p>
            To put an end to red-lantern grilled chicken stands, Ms. Mystia
            started her shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since long ago, it was said that lamprey was good for
            night-blindness, and it was found to be very useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, it's said that people who walk this road at
            become night-blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, many of the people who take the road and become
            nightblind rush into the shop, and others come in to prevent such a
            thing from happening in the first place. Such customers are
            frequent.
          </p>
          <p>Ms. Mystia said,</p>
          <p>
            Night stands that specialize in grilled chicken are strange, aren't
            they.
          </p>
          <p>I think there are other foods that are twice as delicious.</p>
          <p>That 'twice' also goes for sales.</p>
          <p>
            So, I was thinking, it's said that many customers around here become
            night-blind, but I'm the one that causes night-blindness in humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that's the case, I thought that maybe lamprey would be pretty
            popular.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making humans night-blind makes it hard for them to walk around, but
            in that night-blindness they'll see the red light from the laterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            They'll helplessly come in and see that there's lamprey, great for
            night-blindness. Don't you think this is ingenious?
          </p>
          <p>As extra service, you can listen to the shopkeeper sing.</p>
          <p>
            One cannot fully appreciate this song unless they're deep in sake.
            If anyone listens to this wonderful song then, they won't be able to
            go back home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, this extra service cannot be refused. Grilled lamprey over
            grilled chicken.
          </p>
          <p>It may become a popular menu item from now on.</p>
          <p>I tried this and I found it was tasty. It's very good.</p>

            Hey, don't interrupt me while singing.
          </p>

          <p>
            You're the first one who has had no interest in an article about
            yourself...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>I have more fun singing.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Those are some odd lyrics. Well, I really don't mind. I agree with
            you in disliking grilled chicken.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            You're smart. Though we have plenty of foods to eat, they serve only
            grilled chicken at every stand. Why do they do so?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, Does lamprey really have an effect on night-blindness?</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Of course, because it has eight eyes.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Lamprey has only two eyes; the eye-like patterns are the gills.
            Also, there are 14 patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>Eh? But it's effective, so there's no problem.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Well, you're right.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Plus, if it doesn't work, I just release them from the
            night-blindness and pretend it did. That works great!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Eh? You mean you cheat your customer and make a profit on lampreys?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>

          <p>

          <p>I've had enough of your singing.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Isn't it good to cure night-blindness? Or do you want us to be eaten
            too?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>Are you really a night sparrow?</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            ...But, I've had a hard time getting lampreys recently, so I'm a
            little worried.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Aya </span></p>
          <p>
            It's already out of season. Some impatient beings are getting ready
            to hibernate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>That's why I serve not only lampreys, but eels and loaches.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>You don't hesitate to cheat.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's effective, so there's no problem. Is that clear? Here, this
            is skewered grilled lamprey.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Aya</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            OK, OK. I don't care whether it's a fake lamprey or something...
            Wait! This paper below this dish is my newspaper! I specially
            brought it for you~.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Mystia</span>

          <p>Newspapers absorb oil very well. It's convenient.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Could it be that you can't read any characters at all?</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            I-it's not that bad. I mean, it's better to sing a song than wasting
            time by reading a newspaper.
          </p>
