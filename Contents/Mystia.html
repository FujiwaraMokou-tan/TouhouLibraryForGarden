		<img style="width: 300px; height: 302px; float: left;" alt="" src="058BAiJRMystia.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">Recently, 
		a night sparrow has started a promising new business.</p>
		<p>That business is not a grilled chicken stand, but rather, a grilled lamprey 
		stand.</p>
		<p>One day a red-lantern stand suddenly appeared on a road that few people 
		travel at night.</p>
		<p>When someone lured by the inviting red lights and passes through the 
		shop&#39;s curtain, they&#39;ll find a grilled lamprey stand instead of a grilled 
		chicken stand.</p>
		<p>This peculiar ingredient is becoming a topic within the curious circles 
		of Gensokyo.</p>
		<p>The one who runs this stand is Ms. Mystia Lorelei (Night Sparrow).</p>
		<p>To put an end to red-lantern grilled chicken stands, Ms. Mystia started 
		her shop.</p>
		<p>Since long ago, it was said that lamprey was good for night-blindness, 
		and it was found to be very useful.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s said that people who walk this road at become 
		night-blind.</p>
		<p>For that reason, many of the people who take the road and become nightblind 
		rush into the shop, and others come in to prevent such a thing from happening 
		in the first place. Such customers are frequent.</p>
		<p>Ms. Mystia said,</p>
		<p>&quot;Night stands that specialize in grilled chicken are strange, aren&#39;t 
		they.</p>
		<p>I think there are other foods that are twice as delicious.</p>
		<p>That &#39;twice&#39; also goes for sales.</p>
		<p>So, I was thinking, it&#39;s said that many customers around here become 
		night-blind, but I&#39;m the one that causes night-blindness in humans.</p>
		<p>If that&#39;s the case, I thought that maybe lamprey would be pretty popular.</p>
		<p>Making humans night-blind makes it hard for them to walk around, but 
		in that night-blindness they&#39;ll see the red light from the laterns.</p>
		<p>They&#39;ll helplessly come in and see that there&#39;s lamprey, great for night-blindness. 
		Don&#39;t you think this is ingenious?&quot;</p>
		<p>As extra service, you can listen to the shopkeeper sing.</p>
		<p>One cannot fully appreciate this song unless they&#39;re deep in sake. If 
		anyone listens to this wonderful song then, they won&#39;t be able to go back 
		home.</p>
		<p>Also, this extra service cannot be refused. Grilled lamprey over grilled 
		chicken.</p>
		<p>It may become a popular menu item from now on.</p>
		<p>I tried this and I found it was tasty. It&#39;s very good.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Sorry for interrupting you, but I brought you the article I wrote.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Um? Ah, please leave it behind. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dream

		<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Humans will be crucified in the darkness~</span> 
		Hey, don&#39;t interrupt me while singing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re the first one who has had no interest in an article about yourself...</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I have more fun singing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Those are some odd lyrics. Well, I really don&#39;t mind. I agree with you 
		in disliking grilled chicken.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You&#39;re smart. Though we have plenty of foods to eat, they serve only 
		grilled chicken at every stand. Why do they do so?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, Does lamprey really have an effect on night-blindness?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Of course, because it has eight eyes.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Lamprey has only two eyes; the eye-like patterns are the gills. Also, 
		there are 14 patterns.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Eh? But it&#39;s effective, so there&#39;s no problem.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Well, you&#39;re right.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Plus, if it doesn&#39;t work, I just release them from the night-blindness 
		and pretend it did. That works great!</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Eh? You mean you cheat your customer and make a profit on lampreys?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Night bird, night song~</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve had enough of your singing.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Isn&#39;t it good to cure night-blindness? Or do you want us to be eaten 
		too?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Are you really a night sparrow?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Humans light up the darkness~</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I&#39;ve had enough.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>...But, I&#39;ve had a hard time getting lampreys recently, so I&#39;m a little 
		worried.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p>It&#39;s already out of season. Some impatient beings are getting ready to 
		hibernate.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>That&#39;s why I serve not only lampreys, but eels and loaches.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You don&#39;t hesitate to cheat.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>But it&#39;s effective, so there&#39;s no problem. Is that clear? Here, this 
		is skewered grilled lamprey.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>OK, OK. I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s a fake lamprey or something... Wait! 
		This paper below this dish is my newspaper! I specially brought it for you~.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Newspapers absorb oil very well. It&#39;s convenient.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Aren&#39;t you even interested in your own article? I rarely see anyone that 
		isn&#39;t.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I can hardly see those tiny characters.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>Could it be that you can&#39;t read any characters at all?</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mystia</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>I-it&#39;s not that bad. I mean, it&#39;s better to sing a song than wasting 
		time by reading a newspaper.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aya</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>You should read more, otherwise you&#39;ll become more and more of a birdbrain.
