            Almost everyone would recognize that this year's winter was
            unusually long.
            <img
              class="imageSizesOnTextRightSide"

          <p>
            In any other year the cherry blossoms would already be in bloom, but
            this year the falling snowflakes of a blizzard took the place of
            falling cherry blossom petals.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, dancing cherry blossom petals were also mysteriously mixed
            in with the blizzard.
          </p>
          <p>
            No cherry blossoms had bloomed anywhere in Gensokyo, so this fact
            served to increase the likelihood of this incident being the work of
            another party.
          </p>
          <p>
            In light of these details, it was confirmed that the shrine maiden
            began to take action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine maiden's goal seemed to be in the direction the wind was
            coming from.
          </p>
          <p>
            As always, the shrine maiden encountered youkai, and as she attacked
            them for no important reason, caution was necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the position of us tengu, those who live in Gensokyo for a long
            time and are well-informed of its inhabatants are able to learn
            about most humans and youkai and come to generally understand them a
            piece at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After exterminating a number of unfortunate youkai, the shrine
            maiden flew to a place high in the sky, above the clouds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, as I am unable to conceal myself above the clouds, I
            had to abandon any further pursuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as the shrine maiden ascended above the clouds, I was able
            to determine who was the culprit behind this incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a Gensokyo with no blooming cherry blossoms, there were still
            cherry blossom petals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suppose this means that the cherry blossom petals were coming from
            above the clouds. That is to say, the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they were fully enjoying spring above the clouds, then there is a
            very high probability that the blizzard on the ground was also the
            work of the those in the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was only a guess from back then, but the true motive behind the
            cause of the incident must have been simple selfishness, due to the
            fact that those who live in the heavens, like those who live on the
            ground, enjoy easing the difficulty caused by winter blizzards by
            having drinking parties in the spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a fluke how these incidents are almost always caused by those
            with strong powers acting selfishly.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when a major incident occurs, it's up to the shrine maiden to
            figure out who's behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            These selfish incidents are only truly troublesome for the powerless
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            For us youkai, our motto is that fun can be found in any kind of
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the extended winter was truly troublesome for almost none
            of the youkai, who found the circumstances enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, I can let the wind take me as far as it can. Riding the
            wind in such a way is great fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            While trying to master the blizzard was tough, when I was freely
            riding on the wind, it really felt good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entrusting myself to the wind, I also noticed that the wind would
            take me around and around Gensokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even like that, I was able to find evidence that would help me
            understand who would prevent spring from arriving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Winter ended and spring returned somewhere around 2 or 3 days after
            the shrine maiden started her activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she were a more flexible person, I imagine she also would've
            enjoyed seeing the cherry blossom petals mix with the snowflakes in
            the blizzard.

          <p>
            After the scarlet mist incident of the previous year, in May of the
            present year, Gensokyo was still in the middle of winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the usual occurrence of silvery blizzards giving way to cherry
            blossom blizzards was expected, this year it seemed something was
            holding back that occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>
            To bring back spring, Reimu relied on her intuition as always and
            finally arrived at...
